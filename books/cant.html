Denial is the ultimate comfort  zone. </span><span id="cant-line-39">Don’ t worry, you aren’ t alone. In every town, in every country , all over the </span><span id="cant-line-40">world, millions roam the streets, dead -eyed  as zombies, addicted to </span><span id="cant-line-41">comfort, embracing a victim’ s mentality and unaware of their true potential. </span><span id="cant-line-42">I know this because I meet and hear from them all the time, and because </span><span id="cant-line-43">just like you, I used to be one of  them. </span><span id="cant-line-44">I had a damn good excuse  too. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-45">Life dealt me a bad hand. I was born broken, grew up with beat downs, was </span><span id="cant-line-46">tormented in school, and called nigger  more times than I could  count. </span><span id="cant-line-47">We were  once poor, surviving on welfare, living in government -subsidized </span><span id="cant-line-48">housing, and my depression was smothering. I lived life at the bottom of the </span><span id="cant-line-49">barrel, and my future forecast was bleak as  fuck. </span><span id="cant-line-50">Very few people  know how the bottom feels, but I do. It’s like quicksand. It </span><span id="cant-line-51">grabs you, sucks  you under , and won’ t let go. When life is like that it’s easy </span><span id="cant-line-52">to drift and continue to make the same comfortable choices that are killing </span><span id="cant-line-53">you, over and over  again. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-54">But the truth is we all make habitual, self-limiting  choices. It’s as natural as </span><span id="cant-line-55">a sunset and as fundamental as gravity . It’s how our brains are wired, which </span><span id="cant-line-56">is why motivation is  crap. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-57">Even the best pep talk or self-help hack is nothing but a temporary fix. It </span><span id="cant-line-58">won’ t rewire your brain. It won’t amplify your voice or uplift your life. </span><span id="cant-line-59">Motivation changes exactly nobody . The bad hand that was my life was </span><span id="cant-line-60">mine, and mine alone to  fix.So I sought out pain, fell in love with suffering, and eventually transformed </span><span id="cant-line-61">myself from the weakest piece of shit on the planet into the hardest man </span><span id="cant-line-62">God ever created, or so I tell  myself. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-63">Odds are you have had a much  better childhood than I did, and even now </span><span id="cant-line-64">might have a damn decent life, but no matter who you are, who your </span><span id="cant-line-65">parents are or were, where you live, what you do for a living, or how much </span><span id="cant-line-66">money you have, you’re probably living at about 40 percent of your true </span><span id="cant-line-67">capability . </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-68">Damn  shame. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-69">We all have the potential to be so much  more. </span><span id="cant-line-70">Years ago, I was invited to be on a panel at the Massachusetts  Institute of </span><span id="cant-line-71">Technology . I’d never set foot in a university lecture hall as a student. I’d </span><span id="cant-line-72">barely graduate d high school, yet I was at one of the most prestigious </span><span id="cant-line-73">institutions in the country to discuss mental toughness with a handful of </span><span id="cant-line-74">others. At some point in the discussion an esteemed MIT professor said that </span><span id="cant-line-75">we each have genetic limitations. Hard ceilings. That there are some things </span><span id="cant-line-76">we just can’t do no matter how mentally tough we are. When we hit our </span><span id="cant-line-77">genetic ceiling, he said, mental toughness doesn’ t enter into the  equation. </span><span id="cant-line-78">Everyone in that room seemed to accept his version of reality because this </span><span id="cant-line-79">senior , tenured professor was known for researching mental toughness. It </span><span id="cant-line-80">was his life’s work. It was also a bunch of bullshit, and to me he was using </span><span id="cant-line-81">science to let us all of f the hook. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-82">I’d been quiet until then because I was surrounded by all these smart </span><span id="cant-line-83">people, feeling stupid, but some one in the audience noticed the look on my </span><span id="cant-line-84">face and asked if I agreed. And if you ask me a direct question, I won’ t be </span><span id="cant-line-85">shy. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-86">“There’ s something to be said for living it instead of studying it,” I said, </span><span id="cant-line-87">then turned toward the professor . “What you said is true for most people, </span><span id="cant-line-88">but not 100 percent. There will always be the 1 percent of us who are </span><span id="cant-line-89">willing to put in the work to defy the  odds.”I went on to explain what I knew from experience. That anybody can </span><span id="cant-line-90">become a totally different person and achieve what so-called  experts like </span><span id="cant-line-91">him claim is impossible, but it takes a lot of heart, will, and an armored </span><span id="cant-line-92">mind. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-93">Heraclitus, a philosopher born in the Persian Empire back in the fifth </span><span id="cant-line-94">century BC, had it right when he wrote about men on the battlefield. “Out </span><span id="cant-line-95">of every one hundred men,” he wrote, “ten shouldn’ t even be there, eighty </span><span id="cant-line-96">are just targets, nine are the real fighters, and we are lucky to have them, for </span><span id="cant-line-97">they make the battle. Ah, but the one, one is a  warrior…” </span><span id="cant-line-98">From the time you take your first breath, you become eligible to die. You </span><span id="cant-line-99">also become eligible to find your greatness and become the One Warrior . </span><span id="cant-line-100">But it is up to you to equip yourself for the battle ahead. Only you can </span><span id="cant-line-101">master your mind, which is what it takes to live a bold life filled with </span><span id="cant-line-102">accomplishments most people consider beyond their  capability . </span><span id="cant-line-103">I am not a genius like those professors at MIT, but I am that One Warrior . </span><span id="cant-line-104">And the story you are about to read, the story of my fucked -up life, will </span><span id="cant-line-105">illuminate a proven path to self-mastery  and empower you to face reality, </span><span id="cant-line-106">hold yourself accountable, push past pain, learn to love what you fear, relish </span><span id="cant-line-107">failure, live to your fullest potential, and find out who you really  are. </span><span id="cant-line-108">Human beings change through study , habit, and stories. Through my story </span><span id="cant-line-109">you will learn what the body and mind are capable of when they’re driven </span><span id="cant-line-110">to maximum capacity , and how to get there. Because when you’re driven, </span><span id="cant-line-111">whatever is in front of you, whether it’s racism, sexism, injuries, divorce, </span><span id="cant-line-112">depression, obesity , tragedy , or poverty , becomes fuel for your </span><span id="cant-line-113">metamorphosis. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-114">The steps laid out here amoun t to the evolutionary algorithm, one that </span><span id="cant-line-115">obliterates barriers, glimmers with glory , and delivers lasting  peace. </span><span id="cant-line-116">I hope you’re ready . It’s time to go to war with  yourself.CHAPTER ONE </span><span id="cant-line-117">1. I SHOULD HA VE BEEN A </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-118">STATISTIC </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-119">WE FOUND  HELL  IN  A  BEAUTIFU L  NEIGHBORHOOD . I N  1981, W ILLIAMSVILLE </span><span id="cant-line-120">offered the tastie st real estate in Buffalo, New York. Leafy and friendly , its </span><span id="cant-line-121">safe streets were dotted with dainty homes filled with model citizens. </span><span id="cant-line-122">Doctors, attorneys, steel plant executives, dentists, and professional football </span><span id="cant-line-123">players lived there with their adoring wives and their 2.2 kids. Cars were </span><span id="cant-line-124">new, roads swept, possibilitie s endless. We’re talking about a living, </span><span id="cant-line-125">breathing American Dream. Hell was a corner lot on Paradise  Road. </span><span id="cant-line-126">That’ s where we lived in a two-story , four-bedroom , white wooden  home </span><span id="cant-line-127">with four square pillars frami ng a front porch that led to the widest, </span><span id="cant-line-128">greenest lawn in Williamsville. We had a vegetable garden out back and a </span><span id="cant-line-129">two-car garage stocked  with a 1962 Rolls Royce Silver Cloud, a 1980 </span><span id="cant-line-130">Mercedes 450 SLC, and, in the driveway , a sparkling new 1981 black </span><span id="cant-line-131">Corvette. Every one on Paradise Road lived near the top of the food chain, </span><span id="cant-line-132">and based on appearances, most of our neighbors thought that we, the so- </span><span id="cant-line-133">called  happy , well-adjusted  Goggins family , were the tip of that spear . But </span><span id="cant-line-134">glossy surfaces reflect much more than they  reveal. </span><span id="cant-line-135">They’d see us most weekday mornings, gathered in the drivew ay at 7 a.m. </span><span id="cant-line-136">My dad, Trunnis  Goggins, wasn’ t tall but he was handsome and built like a </span><span id="cant-line-137">boxer . He wore tailored suits, his smile warm and open. He looked every bit </span><span id="cant-line-138">the successful businessman on his way to work. My mother , Jackie, was </span><span id="cant-line-139">seventeen years younger , slender and beautiful, and my brother  and I were </span><span id="cant-line-140">clean cut, well dressed in jeans and pastel Izod shirts, and strapped with </span><span id="cant-line-141">backpacks just like the other kids. The white kids. In our version  of affluentAmerica, each driveway was a staging ground for nods and waves before </span><span id="cant-line-142">parents and children rode off to work and school. Neighbors saw what they </span><span id="cant-line-143">wanted. Nobody probed too  deep. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-144">Good thing. The truth was, the Goggins family had just returned home from </span><span id="cant-line-145">another all-nighter  in the hood, and if Paradise Road was Hell, that meant I </span><span id="cant-line-146">lived with the Devil himself. As soon as our neighbors shut the door or </span><span id="cant-line-147">turned the corner , my father ’s smile morphed into a scowl.  He barked </span><span id="cant-line-148">orders and went  inside to sleep another one off, but our work wasn’ t done. </span><span id="cant-line-149">My brother , Trunnis Jr., and I had somewhere to be, and it was up to our </span><span id="cant-line-150">sleepless mother to get us  there. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-151">I was in first grade in 1981, and I was in a school daze, for real. Not </span><span id="cant-line-152">because the academics were hard—at least not yet—but because I couldn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-153">stay awake. The teacher ’s sing-song  voice was my lullaby , my crossed arms </span><span id="cant-line-154">on my desk, a comfy pillow , and her sharp words—once she caught me </span><span id="cant-line-155">dreaming—an unwelcome alarm clock that wouldn’ t stop blaring. Children </span><span id="cant-line-156">that young are infinite sponges. They soak up language and ideas at warp </span><span id="cant-line-157">speed to establish a fundamenta l foundation upon which most people build </span><span id="cant-line-158">life-long skills like reading and spelling and basic math, but because I </span><span id="cant-line-159">worked nights, I couldn’ t conce ntrate on anything most mornings, except </span><span id="cant-line-160">trying to stay  awake. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-161">Recess and PE were a whole different minefield. Out on the playground </span><span id="cant-line-162">staying lucid was the easy part. The hard part was the hiding. Couldn’ t let </span><span id="cant-line-163">my shirt slip. Couldn’ t wear shorts. Bruises were red flags I couldn’ t show </span><span id="cant-line-164">because if I did, I knew I’d catch even more. Still, on that playground and </span><span id="cant-line-165">in the classroom  I knew I was safe, for a little while at least. It was the one </span><span id="cant-line-166">place he couldn’ t reach me, at least not physically . My brother went through </span><span id="cant-line-167">a similar dance in sixth grade, his first year in middle school. He had his </span><span id="cant-line-168">own wounds to hide and sleep to harvest, because once that bell rang, real </span><span id="cant-line-169">life began. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-170">The ride from Williamsville to the Masten District in East Buffalo took </span><span id="cant-line-171">about a half an hour, but it may as well have been a world away . Like much </span><span id="cant-line-172">of East Buffalo, Masten was a mostly black working -class  neighborhood in </span><span id="cant-line-173">the inner city that was rough around the edges; though, in the early 1980s, it </span><span id="cant-line-174">was not yet completely ghetto as fuck. Back then the Bethlehem Steel plantwas still humming and Buffalo was the last great American steel town. </span><span id="cant-line-175">Most men in the city, black and white, worked solid union jobs and earned a </span><span id="cant-line-176">living wage, which meant business in Masten was good. For my dad, it </span><span id="cant-line-177">always had  been. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-178">By the time he was twenty years old he owned a Coca -Cola  distribution </span><span id="cant-line-179">concession and four delivery routes in the Buffalo area. That’ s good money </span><span id="cant-line-180">for a kid, but he had bigger dreams and an eye on the future. His future had </span><span id="cant-line-181">four wheels and a disco funk soundtrack. When a local bakery  shut down, </span><span id="cant-line-182">he leased the building and built one of Buf falo’s first roller skating  rinks. </span><span id="cant-line-183">Fast-forward  ten years and Skateland had been relocated to a building on </span><span id="cant-line-184">Ferry Street that stretched nearly a full block in the heart of the Masten </span><span id="cant-line-185">District. He opened a bar above the rink, which he named the Vermillion </span><span id="cant-line-186">Room. In the 1970s, that was the place to be in East Buffalo, and it’s where </span><span id="cant-line-187">he met my mother when she was just nineteen and he was thirty -six. It was </span><span id="cant-line-188">her first time away from home. Jackie grew up in the Catholic Church. </span><span id="cant-line-189">Trunnis was the son of a minister , and knew her language well enough to </span><span id="cant-line-190">masquerade as a believer , which  appealed to her. But let’s keep it real. She </span><span id="cant-line-191">was just as drunk on his  charm. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-192">Trunnis Jr. was born in 1971. I was born in 1975, and by the time I was six </span><span id="cant-line-193">years old, the roller disco craze was at its absolute peak. Skateland rocked </span><span id="cant-line-194">every night. We’d usually get there around 5 p.m., and while my brother </span><span id="cant-line-195">worked the concession stand—p opping corn, grilling hot dogs, loading the </span><span id="cant-line-196">cooler , and making pizzas—I organized the skates by size and style. Each </span><span id="cant-line-197">afternoon, I stood on a step stool to spray my stock with aerosol deodorizer </span><span id="cant-line-198">and replace the rubber stoppers. That aerosol stink would cloud  all around </span><span id="cant-line-199">my head and live in my nostrils. My eyes looked permanently bloodshot. It </span><span id="cant-line-200">was the only thing I could smell  for hours. But those were the distractions I </span><span id="cant-line-201">had to ignore to stay organized and on hustle. Because my dad, who worked </span><span id="cant-line-202">the DJ booth, was always watching, and if any of those skates went </span><span id="cant-line-203">missing, it meant my ass. Befor e the doors opened I’d polish the skate rink </span><span id="cant-line-204">floor with a dust mop that was twice my  size.Skateland, age six </span><span id="cant-line-205">At around 6 p.m., my mother called us to dinner in the back office. That </span><span id="cant-line-206">woman lived in a permanent state of denial, but her maternal instinct was </span><span id="cant-line-207">real, and it made a big fucking show of itself, grasping for any shred of </span><span id="cant-line-208">normalcy . Every  night in that office, she’d set out two electric burners on </span><span id="cant-line-209">the floor , sit with her legs curled behind her, and prepare a full dinner—roast meat, potatoes, green beans, and dinner rolls, while my dad did the </span><span id="cant-line-210">books and made  calls. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-211">The food was good, but even at six and seven years old I knew our “family </span><span id="cant-line-212">dinner” was a bullshit facsimile compared to what most familie s had. Plus, </span><span id="cant-line-213">we ate fast. There was no time to enjoy it because at 7 p.m. when the doors </span><span id="cant-line-214">opened, it was show time, and we all had to be in our places with our </span><span id="cant-line-215">stations prepped. My dad was the sherif f, and once he stepped into the DJ </span><span id="cant-line-216">booth he had us triangulated. He scanned that room like an all-seeing  eye, </span><span id="cant-line-217">and if you fucked up you’d hear about it. Unless you felt it  first. </span><span id="cant-line-218">The room didn’ t look like much under the harsh, overhead house lights, but </span><span id="cant-line-219">once he dimmed  them, the show  lights bathed the rink in red and glanced </span><span id="cant-line-220">off the spinning  mirror ball, conjuring a skate disco fantasy . Weekend or </span><span id="cant-line-221">weeknight, hund reds of skaters piled through that door. Most of the time </span><span id="cant-line-222">they came in as a family , paying  their $3 entrance fee and half-dollar  skate </span><span id="cant-line-223">fee before hitting the  floor . </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-224">I rented out the skates and managed that entire station by myse lf. I carried </span><span id="cant-line-225">that step stool around like a crutch. Without it, the customers couldn’ t even </span><span id="cant-line-226">see me. The bigger -sized  skates were down below the counter , but the </span><span id="cant-line-227">smaller sizes were stored so high I’d have to scale the shelves, which </span><span id="cant-line-228">always made the customers laugh. Mom was the one and only cashier . She </span><span id="cant-line-229">collected everyone’ s cover charge, and to Trunnis, money was everything. </span><span id="cant-line-230">He coun ted the people as they came in, calculating his take in real time so </span><span id="cant-line-231">he had a rough idea of what to expect when he counted out the register after </span><span id="cant-line-232">we closed up. And it had better all be  there. </span><span id="cant-line-233">All the money was his. The rest of us never earned a cent for our sweat. In </span><span id="cant-line-234">fact, my mother was never given any money of her own. She had no bank </span><span id="cant-line-235">account or credit cards in her name. He controlled everything, and we all </span><span id="cant-line-236">knew what would happen if her cash drawer ever came up  short. </span><span id="cant-line-237">None of the customers who came through our doors knew any of this, of </span><span id="cant-line-238">course. To them , Skateland was a family -owned -and-operated  dream cloud. </span><span id="cant-line-239">My dad spun the fading vinyl  echoes of disco and funk and the early </span><span id="cant-line-240">rumbles of hip hop. Bass bounced off the red walls, courtesy of Buffalo’s </span><span id="cant-line-241">favorite son Rick James, Geor ge Clinton’ s Funkadelic, and the first tracksever released by hip hop innovators Run DMC. Some of the kids were </span><span id="cant-line-242">speed skating. I liked to go fast too, but we had our share of skate dancers, </span><span id="cant-line-243">and that floor got  funky . </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-244">For the first hour or two the parents stayed downstairs and skated, or </span><span id="cant-line-245">watched their kids spin the oval, but they would eventually leak upstairs to </span><span id="cant-line-246">make their own scene, and when enough of them made their move, Trunnis </span><span id="cant-line-247">slipped out of the DJ booth so he could join them. My dad was considered </span><span id="cant-line-248">the unofficial mayor of Masten,  and he was a phony politician to the core. </span><span id="cant-line-249">His customers were his marks , and what they didn’ t know was that no </span><span id="cant-line-250">matter how many drinks he poured on the house and bro hugs he shared, he </span><span id="cant-line-251">didn’ t give a fuck about any of them. They were all dollar signs to him. If </span><span id="cant-line-252">he poured you a drink for free, it was because he knew you would buy two </span><span id="cant-line-253">or three  more. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-254">While we had our share of all-night  skates and twenty -four-hour skate </span><span id="cant-line-255">marathons, the Skateland doors typically closed at 10 p.m. That’s when my </span><span id="cant-line-256">mother , brother , and I went to work, fishing bloody tampons out of shit- </span><span id="cant-line-257">filled  toilets, airing the lingering cannabis haze out of both bathrooms, </span><span id="cant-line-258">scraping bacteria -loaded  gum off the rink floor , cleaning the concession </span><span id="cant-line-259">kitchen, and taking inventory . Just before midnight, we’d slog into the </span><span id="cant-line-260">office, half-dead . Our mother would tuck my brother and me beneath a </span><span id="cant-line-261">blanket on the office sofa, our heads opposite one another , as the ceiling </span><span id="cant-line-262">shook with the sound of bass-heavy  funk. </span><span id="cant-line-263">Mom was still on the  clock. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-264">As soon as she stepped inside the bar, Trunnis had her working the door or </span><span id="cant-line-265">hustling downst airs like a booz e mule to fetch cases of liquor from the </span><span id="cant-line-266">basement. There  was always some menial task to perform and she didn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-267">stop moving, while my father kept watch from his corner of the bar where </span><span id="cant-line-268">he could  take in the whole scene. In those days, Rick James, a Buffalo </span><span id="cant-line-269">native and one of my father ’s closest friends, stopped by whenever he was </span><span id="cant-line-270">in town, parking his Excalibur  on the sidewalk out front. His car was a </span><span id="cant-line-271">billboard that let the hood know a Superfreak was in the house . He wasn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-272">the only celebri ty that came through. OJ Simpson was one of the NFL’s </span><span id="cant-line-273">biggest stars, and he and his Buffalo Bills teammates were regulars, as wasTeddy Pender grass and Sister Sledge. If you don’t know the names, look </span><span id="cant-line-274">them  up. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-275">Maybe if I had been older , or my father had been a good man, I might have </span><span id="cant-line-276">had some pride in being part of a cultural moment like that, but young kids </span><span id="cant-line-277">aren’ t about that life. It’s almost like, no matter who our parents are and </span><span id="cant-line-278">what they do, we’re all born with a moral compass that’s properly tuned. </span><span id="cant-line-279">When you’re six, seven, or eight years old, you know what feels right and </span><span id="cant-line-280">what feels way the fuck off. And when you are born into a cyclo ne of terror </span><span id="cant-line-281">and pain, you know it doesn’ t have to be that way, and that truth nags at you </span><span id="cant-line-282">like a splinter in your jacked up mind. You can choose to ignore it, but the </span><span id="cant-line-283">dull throbbing is always there as the days and nights bleed together into one </span><span id="cant-line-284">blurred  memory . </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-285">Some moments do stick out though, and one I’m thinking of right now still </span><span id="cant-line-286">haunts me. That was the night my mom stepped into the bar before she was </span><span id="cant-line-287">expected and found my dad sweet talking a woman about ten years her </span><span id="cant-line-288">junior . Trunnis saw her watching and shrugged while my mother eyeballed </span><span id="cant-line-289">him and slugged  two shots of Johnnie Walker Red to calm her nerves. He </span><span id="cant-line-290">noticed her reaction and didn’ t like it one damn  bit. </span><span id="cant-line-291">She knew how things were. That T runnis ran prostitutes across the border to </span><span id="cant-line-292">Fort Erie in Canada. A summer cottage belonging to the president of one of </span><span id="cant-line-293">Buffalo’s bigge st banks doubled as his pop-up brothel. He introduced </span><span id="cant-line-294">Buffalo bankers to his girls whenever he needed a longer line of credit, and </span><span id="cant-line-295">those loans always came through. My mom knew the young woman she </span><span id="cant-line-296">was watching was one of the girls in his stable. She’d seen her before. </span><span id="cant-line-297">Once, she walke d in on them fucking on the Skateland office sofa, where </span><span id="cant-line-298">she tucked her children in damn near every night. When she found them </span><span id="cant-line-299">together , the woman smiled at her. Trunnis shrugged. No, my mom wasn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-300">clueless, but seeing it with her own eyes always  burned. </span><span id="cant-line-301">Around midnigh t, my mother drove with one of our security guards to make </span><span id="cant-line-302">a bank deposit. He begged her to leave my father . He told her to leave that </span><span id="cant-line-303">very night. Maybe he knew what was coming. She did too, but she couldn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-304">run because she had no indepe ndent means whatsoever , and she wasn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-305">going to leave us in his hands. Plus, she had no rights to community </span><span id="cant-line-306">property because Trunnis had always refused to marry her, which was ariddle she was only then startin g to solve. My mother came from a solid, </span><span id="cant-line-307">middle class family , and had always been the virtuous type. He resented </span><span id="cant-line-308">that, treated his hookers better than the mother of his sons, and as a result he </span><span id="cant-line-309">had her trapped. She was 100 percent dependent, and if she wanted to leave, </span><span id="cant-line-310">she’d have to walk with nothing at  all. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-311">My brother and I never slept well at Skateland. The ceiling shook too much </span><span id="cant-line-312">because the office was directly  below the dance floor . When my mother </span><span id="cant-line-313">walked in that night I was alread y awake. She smiled, but I noticed the tears </span><span id="cant-line-314">in her eyes and remember smelling the scotch on her breath when she </span><span id="cant-line-315">scooped me up in her arms as tenderly as she could. My father trailed in </span><span id="cant-line-316">after her, sloppy and annoyed. He pulled a pistol from beneath the cushion </span><span id="cant-line-317">where I slept (yes, you read that right, there was a loaded gun under the </span><span id="cant-line-318">cushion on which I slept at six years old!), flashed it at me, and smiled </span><span id="cant-line-319">before concealing it beneath his pant leg in an ankle holster . In his other </span><span id="cant-line-320">hand were two brown paper shopping bags filled with nearly  $10,000 in </span><span id="cant-line-321">cash. So far it was a typical  night. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-322">My parents didn’ t speak on the drive home, though the tension between </span><span id="cant-line-323">them simmered.  My mom pulled into the driveway on Paradise Road just </span><span id="cant-line-324">before 6 a.m., a little early by our standards. Trunnis stumbled from the car, </span><span id="cant-line-325">disabled the alarm, dropped the cash on the kitchen table, and went upstairs. </span><span id="cant-line-326">We follo wed him, and she tucked us both into our beds, kissed  me on the </span><span id="cant-line-327">forehead, and turned out the light before slipping into the master suite </span><span id="cant-line-328">where she found him waiting, stroking his leather belt. Trunnis didn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-329">appreciate being glared at by my mom, especially in  public. </span><span id="cant-line-330">“This belt came all the way from  Texas just to whip you,” he said, calmly . </span><span id="cant-line-331">Then he started swinging it, buckle first. Sometimes my mother fought </span><span id="cant-line-332">back, and she did that night. She threw a marble candlestick at his head. He </span><span id="cant-line-333">ducked and it thudded the wall. She ran into the bathroom, locked the door, </span><span id="cant-line-334">and cowered on the toilet. He kicked the door down and backhanded her </span><span id="cant-line-335">hard. Her head slammed into the wall. She was barely conscious when he </span><span id="cant-line-336">grabbed a fistful of her hair and dragged her down the  hall. </span><span id="cant-line-337">By then my brother and I had heard the violence, and we watch ed him drag </span><span id="cant-line-338">her all the way down the stairs to the first floor , then crouch over her with </span><span id="cant-line-339">the belt in his hand. She was bleeding from the temple and the lip, and thesight of her blood lit a fuse in me. In that moment my hatred overcame my </span><span id="cant-line-340">fear. I ran downstairs and jump ed on his back, slammed my tiny fists into </span><span id="cant-line-341">his back, and scratched at his eyes. I’d caught him off guard and he fell to </span><span id="cant-line-342">one knee. I wailed on  him. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-343">“Don’ t hit my mom!” I yelled. He tossed me to the ground, stalked toward </span><span id="cant-line-344">me, belt in hand, then turned toward my  mother . </span><span id="cant-line-345">“You’re raising a gangster ,” he said, half-smiling . </span><span id="cant-line-346">I curled  into a ball when he started swinging his belt at me. I could feel </span><span id="cant-line-347">bruises rise on my back as my mom crawled toward the control pad near the </span><span id="cant-line-348">front door. She pressed the panic button and the house exploded in alarm. </span><span id="cant-line-349">He froze, looked toward the ceiling, mopped his brow with his sleeve, took </span><span id="cant-line-350">a deep breath, looped and buckled his belt, and went upstairs to wash off all </span><span id="cant-line-351">that evil and hate. Police were on their way , and he knew  it. </span><span id="cant-line-352">My mother ’s relief was short -lived . When the cops arrived, Trunnis met </span><span id="cant-line-353">them at the door. They looked over his shoulder toward my mom, who </span><span id="cant-line-354">stood several paces behind him, her face swollen and caked with dried </span><span id="cant-line-355">blood. But those  were different days. There was no #metoo back then. That </span><span id="cant-line-356">shit didn’ t exist, and they ignore d her. Trunnis told them it was all a whole </span><span id="cant-line-357">lot of nothing. Just some necessary domestic  discipline. </span><span id="cant-line-358">“Look at this house. Does it look like I mistreat my wife?” He asked. “I </span><span id="cant-line-359">give her mink coats, diamond rings, I bust my ass to give her everything she </span><span id="cant-line-360">wants, and she throws a marble candlestick at my head. She’ s spoiled.” </span><span id="cant-line-361">The police chuckled along with my father as he walked them to their car. </span><span id="cant-line-362">They left withou t interviewing her. He didn’ t hit her again that morning. He </span><span id="cant-line-363">didn’ t have to. The psychologic al damage was done. From that point on it </span><span id="cant-line-364">was clear to us that as far as Trunnis and the law were concerned it was </span><span id="cant-line-365">open season, and we were the  hunted. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-366">Over the next year, our sched ule didn’ t change much and the beatings </span><span id="cant-line-367">continued, while my mother tried to paper over the darkness with swatches </span><span id="cant-line-368">of light. She knew I wanted to be a Scout, so she signed me up for a local </span><span id="cant-line-369">troop. I still remember putting on that navy blue Cub Scout button downone Saturday . I felt proud wearing a uniform and knowing at least for a few </span><span id="cant-line-370">hours I could pretend that I was a normal kid. My mom smiled as we </span><span id="cant-line-371">headed for the door. My pride, her smile, wasn’ t just because of the damn </span><span id="cant-line-372">Cub Scouts. They rose up from a deeper place. We were takin g action to </span><span id="cant-line-373">find something positive for ourselves in a bleak situation. It was proof that </span><span id="cant-line-374">we mattered, and that we weren’ t completely  powerless. </span><span id="cant-line-375">That’ s when my father came home from the V ermillion  Room. </span><span id="cant-line-376">“Where you two going?” He glared at me. I stared at the floor . My mother </span><span id="cant-line-377">cleared her  throat. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-378">“I’m taking David to his first Cub Scout meeting,” she said, softly . </span><span id="cant-line-379">“The hell you are!” I looked up, and he laughed as my eyes welled up with </span><span id="cant-line-380">tears. “W e’re going to the  track.” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-381">Within the hour we’d arrived at Batavia Downs, an old-school  harness </span><span id="cant-line-382">horse race track, the type where jockeys ride behind the horses in </span><span id="cant-line-383">lightweight buggies. My dad grabbed a racing form as soon we stepped </span><span id="cant-line-384">through the gate. For hours, the three of us watched him place bet after bet, </span><span id="cant-line-385">chain smoke, drink scotch, and raise holy hell as every pony  he bet on </span><span id="cant-line-386">finished out of the money . With my dad raging at the gambling gods and </span><span id="cant-line-387">acting a fool, I tried to make myself as small as possible whenever people </span><span id="cant-line-388">walked by, but I still stuck out. I was the only kid in the stands dressed like </span><span id="cant-line-389">a Cub Scout. I was probably the only black Cub Scout they’d ever seen, and </span><span id="cant-line-390">my uniform was a lie. I was a  pretender . </span><span id="cant-line-391">Trunnis lost thousands of dollars that day, and he wouldn’ t shut up about it </span><span id="cant-line-392">on the drive home, his raspy throat raw from nicotine. My brother and I </span><span id="cant-line-393">were in the cramped back seat and whenever he spat out the window , his </span><span id="cant-line-394">phlegm boomer anged into my face. Each drop of his nasty saliva on my </span><span id="cant-line-395">skin burned like venom and intensified my hate. I’d long since learned that </span><span id="cant-line-396">the best way to avoid a beat down was to make myself as invisible as </span><span id="cant-line-397">possible, avert my eyes, float outside my body , and hope to go unnoticed. It </span><span id="cant-line-398">was a practice we’d all honed over the years, but I was done with that shit. I </span><span id="cant-line-399">would no longer hide from the Devil. That afternoon as he veered onto the </span><span id="cant-line-400">highway and headed home, he continued to rave on, and I mad-dogged  himfrom the back seat. Have you ever heard the phrase, “Faith Over  Fear”? For </span><span id="cant-line-401">me it was Hate Over  Fear. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-402">He caught my eyes in the rearview  mirror . </span><span id="cant-line-403">“You got something to  say?!” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-404">“We shouldn’ t have gone to the track anyway ,” I said. </span><span id="cant-line-405">My brother turned and stared at me like I’d lost my damn mind. My mother </span><span id="cant-line-406">squirmed in her  seat. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-407">“Say that one more time.” His words came slow, dripping with dread. I </span><span id="cant-line-408">didn’ t say a word, so he started  reaching behind the seat trying to smack </span><span id="cant-line-409">me. But I was so small, it was easy to hide. The car veered left and right as </span><span id="cant-line-410">he was half-turned  in my direction , punching air. He’d barely touched me, </span><span id="cant-line-411">which only stoked his fire. We drove in silence until he caught his breath. </span><span id="cant-line-412">“When we get home, you’re gonna take your clothes of f,” he  said. </span><span id="cant-line-413">That’ s what he’d say when he was ready to bestow a serious beat down, and </span><span id="cant-line-414">there was no avoiding it. I did what I was told. I went into my bedroom and </span><span id="cant-line-415">took off my clothes, walked down the hall to his room, closed the door </span><span id="cant-line-416">behind me, turned the lights off, then laid across the corner of the bed with </span><span id="cant-line-417">my legs dangling, my torso stretched out in front of me, and my ass </span><span id="cant-line-418">exposed. That was the protocol, and he’d designed it for maximum </span><span id="cant-line-419">psychological and physical  pain. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-420">The beatings were often brutal, but the anticipation was the worst part. I </span><span id="cant-line-421">couldn’ t see the door behind me, and he’d take his time, letting my dread </span><span id="cant-line-422">build. When I heard him open the door, my panic spiked. Even then the </span><span id="cant-line-423">room was so dark I couldn’ t see much with my peripheral vision, and </span><span id="cant-line-424">couldn’ t prepare for the first smack until his belt hit my skin. It was never </span><span id="cant-line-425">just two or three lickings either . There was no particular count, so we never </span><span id="cant-line-426">knew when or if he was gonna  stop. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-427">This beating lasted minutes upon minutes. He started on my butt, but the </span><span id="cant-line-428">sting was so bad I blocked it with my hands, so he moved down  and started </span><span id="cant-line-429">whipping my thighs. When I dropped my hands to my thighs he swung atmy lower back. He belted me dozens of times, and was breathless, coughing </span><span id="cant-line-430">and slick with sweat by the time it was over. I was breathing heavy too, but </span><span id="cant-line-431">I wasn’t crying. His evil was too real and my hate gave me courage. I </span><span id="cant-line-432">refused to give that motherfucker the satisfaction. I just stood up, looked the </span><span id="cant-line-433">Devil in his eye, limped to my room, and stood in front of a mirror . I was </span><span id="cant-line-434">covered in welts from my neck to the crease at the knees. I didn’t go to </span><span id="cant-line-435">school for several  days. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-436">When you’re getting beat consistently , hope evaporates. You stifle your </span><span id="cant-line-437">emotions, but your trauma off-gasses  in unconscious ways. After countless </span><span id="cant-line-438">beatings she endured and witnessed, this particular beat down left my </span><span id="cant-line-439">mother in a constant fog, a shell of the woman I remembered from a few </span><span id="cant-line-440">years before. She was distracted and vacant most of the time, except when </span><span id="cant-line-441">he called her name. Then she’d hop-to like she was his slave. I didn’ t know </span><span id="cant-line-442">until years later that she was considering  suicide. </span><span id="cant-line-443">My brother and I took our pain out on each other . We’d sit or stand across </span><span id="cant-line-444">from one another and he would throw punches as hard as he could at me. It </span><span id="cant-line-445">usually started out as a game, but he was four years older , much stronger , </span><span id="cant-line-446">and he connecte d with all his power . Whenever I’d fall, I’d get up and he’d </span><span id="cant-line-447">hit me again, as hard as he could, yelling like a martial arts warrior at the </span><span id="cant-line-448">top of his lungs, his face twisted with  rage. </span><span id="cant-line-449">“You’re not hurting me! Is that all you fucking have?” I’d shout back. I </span><span id="cant-line-450">wanted him to know that I could  take more pain than he could ever deliver , </span><span id="cant-line-451">but when it was time to fall asleep and there were no more battles to fight, </span><span id="cant-line-452">no place to hide, I wet the bed. Nearly every  night. </span><span id="cant-line-453">My mother ’s every day was a lesson in survival. She was told she was </span><span id="cant-line-454">worthless so often she started to believe it. Everything she did was an effort </span><span id="cant-line-455">to appease him so he wouldn’ t beat her sons or whip her ass, but there were </span><span id="cant-line-456">invisible trip wires in her world and sometimes she never knew when or </span><span id="cant-line-457">how she set them  off until after he slapped the shit out of her. Other times </span><span id="cant-line-458">she knew she teed herself up for a vicious beat  down. </span><span id="cant-line-459">One day I came home early from school with a nasty earache and laid down </span><span id="cant-line-460">on my mother ’s side of their bed, my left ear throbbing in excruciating pain. </span><span id="cant-line-461">With each throb my hate spiked . I knew I wouldn’ t be going to the doctorbecause my father didn’ t appro ve of spending his money on doctors or </span><span id="cant-line-462">dentists. We didn’ t have health insurance, a pediatrician, or a dentist. If we </span><span id="cant-line-463">got injured or sick, we were told to shake it off because he wasn’ t down to </span><span id="cant-line-464">pay for anything that didn’ t directly benefit Trunnis Goggins. Our health </span><span id="cant-line-465">didn’ t meet that standard, and that pissed me the fuck  off. </span><span id="cant-line-466">After about a half hour, my mother came upstairs to check on me and when </span><span id="cant-line-467">I rolled onto my back she could see blood dribbling down the side of my </span><span id="cant-line-468">neck and smeared all over the  pillow . </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-469">“That’ s it,” she said, “come with  me.” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-470">She got me out of bed, dressed me, and helped me to her car, but before she </span><span id="cant-line-471">could start the engine, my dad chased us  down. </span><span id="cant-line-472">“Where you think you’re  going?!” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-473">“The emergency room,” she said as she turned the ignition. He reached for </span><span id="cant-line-474">the handle but she peeled out first, leaving him in her dust. Furious, he </span><span id="cant-line-475">stomped inside, slammed the door , and called out to my  brother . </span><span id="cant-line-476">“Son, get me a Johnnie Walker !” Trunnis Jr. brought over a bottle of Red </span><span id="cant-line-477">Label and a glass from the wet bar. He poured and poured and watched my </span><span id="cant-line-478">dad down shot after shot. Each one fueled an inferno. “You and David need </span><span id="cant-line-479">to be strong,” he raved. “I’m not raising a bunch of faggots!  And that’s </span><span id="cant-line-480">what you’ll be if you go to the doctor every time you get a little boo boo, </span><span id="cant-line-481">understand?” My brother nodd ed, petrified. “Your last name is Goggins, </span><span id="cant-line-482">and we shake it  off!” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-483">According to the doctor we saw that night, my mother got me to the ER just </span><span id="cant-line-484">in time. My ear infection was so bad that if we’d waited any longer, I would </span><span id="cant-line-485">have lost my hearing in my left ear for life. She risked her ass to save mine </span><span id="cant-line-486">and we both knew she’d pay for it. W e drove home in eerie  silence. </span><span id="cant-line-487">My dad was still stewing at the kitchen table by the time we turned onto </span><span id="cant-line-488">Paradise Road, and my brother was still pouring him shots. Trunnis Jr. </span><span id="cant-line-489">feared our father , but he also worshipped the man and was under his spell. </span><span id="cant-line-490">As the first born son he was treated better . Trunnis would still lash out athim, but in his warped mind, Trunnis Jr. was his prince. “Whe n you grow </span><span id="cant-line-491">up I’m gonna want to see you be the man of your house,” Trunnis told him. </span><span id="cant-line-492">“And you’re gonna see me be a man  tonight.” </span><span id="cant-line-493">Moments after we walked through the front door, Trunnis beat our mother </span><span id="cant-line-494">senseless, but my brother could n’t watch. Whenever the beatings exploded </span><span id="cant-line-495">like a thundersto rm overhead, he’d wait them out in his room. He ignored </span><span id="cant-line-496">the darkness because the truth was way too heavy for him to carry. I always </span><span id="cant-line-497">paid close fucking  attention. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-498">During the summers, there was no midweek respite from Trunnis, but my </span><span id="cant-line-499">brother and I learned to hop on our bikes and stay far away for as long as </span><span id="cant-line-500">we could. One day, I came home for lunch and entered the house through </span><span id="cant-line-501">the garage like normal. My father usually slept deep into the afternoon, so I </span><span id="cant-line-502">figured the coast was clear . I was wrong. My father was paranoid. He did </span><span id="cant-line-503">enough shady deals to attract some enemies, and he’d set the alarm after we </span><span id="cant-line-504">left the  house. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-505">When I opened the door, sirens screamed and my stomach dropped. I froze, </span><span id="cant-line-506">backed up against the wall, and listened for footsteps. I heard the stairs </span><span id="cant-line-507">creak and knew I was fucked. He came downstairs in his brown terrycloth </span><span id="cant-line-508">robe, pistol in hand, and crossed from the dining room into the living room, </span><span id="cant-line-509">his gun out front. I could see the barrel come around the corner  slowly . </span><span id="cant-line-510">As soon as he cleared the corner he could see me standing just twenty feet </span><span id="cant-line-511">away , but he didn’ t drop his weapon. He aimed it right between my eyes. I </span><span id="cant-line-512">stared straight at him, blank as possible, my feet anchored to the floor </span><span id="cant-line-513">boards. There was no one else in the house, and part of me expe cted him to </span><span id="cant-line-514">pull the trigger , but by this time in my life I no longer cared if I lived or </span><span id="cant-line-515">died. I was an exhausted eight -year-old kid, plain old fucking tired of being </span><span id="cant-line-516">terrified of my father , and I was sick of Skateland too. After a minute or two </span><span id="cant-line-517">he lowered his weapon and went back  upstairs. </span><span id="cant-line-518">By now it was becoming clear that someone was going to die on Paradise </span><span id="cant-line-519">Road. My moth er knew where Trunnis kept his .38. Some days she timed </span><span id="cant-line-520">and followed him—envisioned how it would play out. They’d take separate </span><span id="cant-line-521">cars to Skatelan d, she’d grab his gun from beneath the office sofa cushions </span><span id="cant-line-522">before he could get there, bring  us home early , put us to bed, and wait forhim by the front door with his gun in hand. When he pulled up, she’d step </span><span id="cant-line-523">out the front door and murder him in his driveway—leave his body for the </span><span id="cant-line-524">milkman to find. My uncles, her brothers, talked her out of it, but they </span><span id="cant-line-525">agreed she needed to do something drastic or she’d be the one lying  dead. </span><span id="cant-line-526">It was an old neighbor who showed her a way. Betty used to live across the </span><span id="cant-line-527">street from us and after she moved they stayed in touch. Betty was twenty </span><span id="cant-line-528">years older than my mom and had the wisdom to match. She encouraged </span><span id="cant-line-529">my moth er to plan her escape weeks in advance. The first step was getting a </span><span id="cant-line-530">credit card in her name. That meant she had to re-earn Trunnis’ trust </span><span id="cant-line-531">because she needed him to cosign. Betty also reminded my mother to keep </span><span id="cant-line-532">their friendship a  secret. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-533">For a few week s Jackie played Trunnis, treated him like she did when she </span><span id="cant-line-534">was a nineteen -year-old beauty with stars in her eyes. She made him believe </span><span id="cant-line-535">she worshipped him again, and when she slipped a credit card application in </span><span id="cant-line-536">front of him, he said he’d be happy to score her a little buying power . When </span><span id="cant-line-537">the card arrived in the mail, my mother felt its hard plastic edges through </span><span id="cant-line-538">the enve lope as relief saturated her mind. She held it at arms  length and </span><span id="cant-line-539">admired it. It glowed like a golden  ticket. </span><span id="cant-line-540">A few days later she heard my father talking shit about her on the phone to </span><span id="cant-line-541">one of his friends, while he was having breakfast with my brother and me at </span><span id="cant-line-542">the kitchen table. That did it. She walked over to the table and said, “I’m </span><span id="cant-line-543">leaving your father . You two can stay or you can come with  me.” </span><span id="cant-line-544">My dad was stunned silent and so was my brother , but I shot out of that </span><span id="cant-line-545">chair like it was on fire, grabbed a few black garbage bags, and went </span><span id="cant-line-546">upstairs to start packing. My brother eventually started gathering his things </span><span id="cant-line-547">too. Before we left, the four of us had one last pow wow at that kitchen </span><span id="cant-line-548">table. T runnis glared at my mother , filled with shock and  contempt. </span><span id="cant-line-549">“You have nothing and you are nothing without me,” he said. “You’re </span><span id="cant-line-550">uneducated, you don’t have any money or prospects. You’ll be a prostitute </span><span id="cant-line-551">inside a year.” He paused then shifted his focus to my brother and me. “You </span><span id="cant-line-552">two are gonna grow up to be a couple of faggots. And don’t think about </span><span id="cant-line-553">coming back, Jackie. I’ll have another woman here to take your place five </span><span id="cant-line-554">minutes after you  leave.”She nodded and stood. She’d given him her youth, her very soul, and she </span><span id="cant-line-555">was finally finished. She packed as little of her past as possible.  She left the </span><span id="cant-line-556">mink coats and the diamond rings. He could give them to his whore </span><span id="cant-line-557">girlfriend as far as she was  concerned. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-558">Trunnis watched  us load up into my mom’ s Volvo (the one vehicle he </span><span id="cant-line-559">owned that he wouldn’ t ride in), our bikes already strapped to the back. We </span><span id="cant-line-560">drove off slowl y and at first he didn’ t budge, but before she turned the </span><span id="cant-line-561">corner I could see him move toward the garage. My mother floored  it. </span><span id="cant-line-562">Give her credit, she’d planned for contingencies. She figured he’d tail her, </span><span id="cant-line-563">so she didn’ t head west to the interstate that would take us to her parent’ s </span><span id="cant-line-564">place in Indiana. Instead, she drove to Betty’ s house, down a dirt </span><span id="cant-line-565">construction road that my dad didn’ t even know about. Betty had the garage </span><span id="cant-line-566">door open when we arrived. We pulled in. Betty yanked the door down, and </span><span id="cant-line-567">while my father shot out on the highway in his Corvette to chase after us, </span><span id="cant-line-568">we waited right under his nose until just before nightfall. By then we knew </span><span id="cant-line-569">he’d be at Skate land, opening up. He wasn’ t going to miss a chance to make </span><span id="cant-line-570">some money . No matter  what. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-571">Shit went wrong  about ninety miles outside of Buffalo when the old Volvo </span><span id="cant-line-572">started burning oil. Huge plumes of inky exhaust choked from the tail pipe </span><span id="cant-line-573">and my mother spun into panic mode. It was as if she’d been holding it all </span><span id="cant-line-574">in, stuffing her fear down deep, hiding it beneath a mask of forced </span><span id="cant-line-575">composure, until an obstacle emer ged and she fell apart. Tears streaked her </span><span id="cant-line-576">face. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-577">“What do I do?” My mom asked, her eyes wide as saucers. My brother </span><span id="cant-line-578">never wanted to leave, and he told her to turn around. I was riding shotgun. </span><span id="cant-line-579">She looked over expectantly . “What do I  do?” </span><span id="cant-line-580">“We gotta go, mom,” I said. “Mom, we gotta  go.” </span><span id="cant-line-581">She pulled into a gas station in the middle of nowhere. Hysterical, she </span><span id="cant-line-582">rushed to a pay phone and called  Betty . </span><span id="cant-line-583">“I can’ t do this, Betty ,” she said. “The car broke down. I have to go  back!”“Where are you?” Betty asked, calmly . </span><span id="cant-line-584">“I don’ t know ,” my mom replied. “I have no idea where I  am!” </span><span id="cant-line-585">Betty told her to find a gas station attendant—every station had those back </span><span id="cant-line-586">then—and put him on the phone . He explained we were just outside of Erie, </span><span id="cant-line-587">Pennsylvania, and after Betty gave him some instructions, he put my </span><span id="cant-line-588">mother back on the  line. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-589">“Jackie, there’ s a Volvo dealer in Erie. Find a hotel tonight and take the car </span><span id="cant-line-590">there tomorrow morning. The attendant is going to put enough oil in the car </span><span id="cant-line-591">to get you there.” My mother was listening but she didn’ t respond. “Jackie? </span><span id="cant-line-592">Are you hearing me? Do what I say and it will be  okay .” </span><span id="cant-line-593">“Yeah. Okay,” she whispered, emotionally spent. “Hotel. Volvo dealer . Got </span><span id="cant-line-594">it.” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-595">I don’t know what Erie is like now, but back then there was only one decent </span><span id="cant-line-596">hotel in town: a Holiday Inn, not far from the Volvo dealership.  My brother </span><span id="cant-line-597">and I followed my mom to the reception desk where we were hit with more </span><span id="cant-line-598">bad news. They were fully booked. My mother ’s shoulders slumped. My </span><span id="cant-line-599">brother and I stood on either side of her, holding our clothes in black trash </span><span id="cant-line-600">bags. W e were the picture of desperation, and the night manager saw  it. </span><span id="cant-line-601">“Look, I’ll set you up with some rollaway beds in the conferenc e room,” he </span><span id="cant-line-602">said. “There’s a bathroom down there, but you have to be out early because </span><span id="cant-line-603">we have a conference starting at 9 a.m.” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-604">Grateful, we bedded down in that conference room with its industrial carpet </span><span id="cant-line-605">and fluorescent lights, our own personal purgatory . We were on the run and </span><span id="cant-line-606">on the ropes, but my mother hadn’ t folded. She laid back and stared at the </span><span id="cant-line-607">ceiling tiles until we nodded off. Then she slipped into an adjacent coffee </span><span id="cant-line-608">shop to keep an anxious eye on our bikes, and on the road, all night  long. </span><span id="cant-line-609">We were waiting outside that Volvo dealership when the garage opened up, </span><span id="cant-line-610">which gave the mechanics just enough time to source the part we needed </span><span id="cant-line-611">and get us back  on the road before their day was done. We left Erie at </span><span id="cant-line-612">sunset and drove all night, arriving at my grandparents’ house in Brazil,Indiana, eight hours later. My mom wept as she parked next to their old </span><span id="cant-line-613">wooden house before dawn, and I understood  why. </span><span id="cant-line-614">Our arrival felt significant, then and now. I was still only eight years old, </span><span id="cant-line-615">but already in a second phase of life. I didn’ t know what awaited  me—what </span><span id="cant-line-616">awaited us—in that small, rural , Southern Indiana town, and I didn’ t much </span><span id="cant-line-617">care. All I knew was that we’d escaped from Hell, and for the first time in </span><span id="cant-line-618">my life, we were free from the Devil  himself. </span><span id="cant-line-619">*** </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-620">We stayed with my grandparents for the next six months, and I enrolled in </span><span id="cant-line-621">second grade— for the second time—at a local Catholic school called </span><span id="cant-line-622">Annunciation. I was the only eight -year-old in second grade, but none of </span><span id="cant-line-623">the other kids knew I was repeating a year, and there was no doubt that I </span><span id="cant-line-624">needed it. I could barely read, but I was lucky enough to have Sister </span><span id="cant-line-625">Katherine as my teacher . Short and petite, Sister Katherine was sixty years </span><span id="cant-line-626">old and had one gold front tooth. She was a nun but didn’ t wear the habit. </span><span id="cant-line-627">She was also grumpy as hell and took no shit, and I loved her thug  ass.Second grade in Brazil </span><span id="cant-line-628">Annunciation was a small school. Sister Katherine taught all of first and </span><span id="cant-line-629">second grade in a single classro om, and with only eighteen kids to teach, </span><span id="cant-line-630">she wasn’ t willing to shirk her responsibility and blame my academic </span><span id="cant-line-631">struggles, or anybody’ s bad behavior , on learning disabilities or emotional </span><span id="cant-line-632">problems. She didn’ t know my backstory and didn’ t have to. All that </span><span id="cant-line-633">mattered to her was that I turned up at her door with a kinder garten </span><span id="cant-line-634">education, and it was her job to shape my mind. She had every excuse in the </span><span id="cant-line-635">world to farm me out to some specialist or label me a problem, but that </span><span id="cant-line-636">wasn’ t her style. She started teaching before labeling kids was a normal </span><span id="cant-line-637">thing to do, and she embodied the no-excuses  mentali ty that I needed if I </span><span id="cant-line-638">was going to catch  up.Sister Katherine is the reason why I’ll never trust a smile or judge a scowl. </span><span id="cant-line-639">My dad smiled a hell of a lot, and he didn’ t give two shits about me, but </span><span id="cant-line-640">grouchy Sister Katherine cared about us, cared about me. She wanted us to </span><span id="cant-line-641">be our very best. I know this because she proved it by spendin g extra time </span><span id="cant-line-642">with me, as much time as it took, until I retained my lessons. Before the </span><span id="cant-line-643">year was out, I could read at a second grade level. Trunnis Jr. hadn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-644">adjusted nearly as well. Within a few months he was back in Buffalo, </span><span id="cant-line-645">shadowing my father and working that Skateland detail like he’d never  left. </span><span id="cant-line-646">By then, we’d moved into a place of our own: a 600-square -foot, two- </span><span id="cant-line-647">bedroom  apartment at Lamplight Manor , a public housing block, that cost </span><span id="cant-line-648">us $7 a month. My father , who earned thousands every night, sporadically </span><span id="cant-line-649">sent $25 every three or four weeks (if that) for child support, while my </span><span id="cant-line-650">mother earned a few hundred dollars a month with her departme nt store job. </span><span id="cant-line-651">In her off-hours  she was taking  courses at Indiana State University , which </span><span id="cant-line-652">cost money too. The point is, we had gaps to fill, so my mother enrolled in </span><span id="cant-line-653">welfare and received $123 a month and food stamps. They wrote her a </span><span id="cant-line-654">check for the first month, but when they found out she owned a car they </span><span id="cant-line-655">disqualified her , explaining that if she sold her car they’d be happy to  help. </span><span id="cant-line-656">The problem is we lived in a rural town with a population of about 8,000 </span><span id="cant-line-657">that didn’ t have a mass transit system. We needed that car so I could get to </span><span id="cant-line-658">school, and so she could get to work and take night classes. She was hell- </span><span id="cant-line-659">bent on chan ging her life circumstances and found a workaround through </span><span id="cant-line-660">the Aide to Dependent Children  program. She arranged for our check to go </span><span id="cant-line-661">to my grandmother who signed it over to her, but that didn’ t make life easy. </span><span id="cant-line-662">How far can $123 really  go? </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-663">I vividly recall one night we were so broke we drove home on a gas tank </span><span id="cant-line-664">that was near empty , to a bare refrigerator and a past due electr ic bill, with </span><span id="cant-line-665">no money in the bank. Then I remembered that we had two mason jars </span><span id="cant-line-666">filled with pennies and other loose change. I grabbed them of f the shelf. </span><span id="cant-line-667">“Mom, let’ s count our  change!” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-668">She smiled. Growing up, her father had taught her to pick up the change she </span><span id="cant-line-669">found on the street. He was molded by the Great Depression and knew what </span><span id="cant-line-670">it was like to be down and out. “You never know when you might need it,”he’d say. When we lived in Hell, carrying home thousands of dollars every </span><span id="cant-line-671">night, the notion that we would ever run out of money sounded ludicrous, </span><span id="cant-line-672">but my mother retained her childhood habit. Trunnis used to belittle her for </span><span id="cant-line-673">it, but now it was time to see how far found money could take  us. </span><span id="cant-line-674">We dumped that change out on the living room floor and counted out </span><span id="cant-line-675">enough to cover the electric bill, fill the gas tank, and buy groceries. We </span><span id="cant-line-676">even had enough to buy burgers at Hardee’ s on the way home. These were </span><span id="cant-line-677">dark times, but we were managing. Barely . My mother missed  Trunnis Jr. </span><span id="cant-line-678">terribly , but she was pleased that I was adjusting and making friends. I’d </span><span id="cant-line-679">had a good year at school, and from our first night in Indiana I hadn’ t wet </span><span id="cant-line-680">the bed once. It seemed that I was healing, but my demons weren’ t gone. </span><span id="cant-line-681">They were dormant. And when they came back, they hit  hard. </span><span id="cant-line-682">*** </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-683">Third grade was a shock to my system. Not just because we had to learn </span><span id="cant-line-684">cursive when I was still getting the hang of reading block letters, but </span><span id="cant-line-685">because our teacher , Ms. D, was nothing like Sister Katherine . Our class </span><span id="cant-line-686">was still small, we had about twenty kids total, split between third and </span><span id="cant-line-687">fourth grade, but she didn’ t handle it nearly as well and wasn’ t interested in </span><span id="cant-line-688">taking the extra time I  required. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-689">My trouble started with the standardized test we took during our first couple </span><span id="cant-line-690">of week s of class. Mine came back a mess. I was still way behind the other </span><span id="cant-line-691">kids and I had trouble building on lessons from the previous days, let alone </span><span id="cant-line-692">the previous academic year. Sister Katherine considered similar signs as </span><span id="cant-line-693">cues to dedicate more time with her weakest student, and she challenged me </span><span id="cant-line-694">daily . Ms. D looked for a way out. Within the first month of class, she told </span><span id="cant-line-695">my mother that I belonged in a dif ferent school. One for “special  students.” </span><span id="cant-line-696">Every kid knows what “special” means. It means you are about to be </span><span id="cant-line-697">stigmatized for the rest of your damn life. It means that you are not normal. </span><span id="cant-line-698">The threat alone was a trigger , and I developed a stutter almost overnight. </span><span id="cant-line-699">My thought -to-speech  flow was jamm ed up with stress and anxiety , and it </span><span id="cant-line-700">was at its worst in  school.Imagine being the only black kid in class, in the entire school, and enduring </span><span id="cant-line-701">the daily humiliation of also being the dumbest. I felt like everything I tried </span><span id="cant-line-702">to do or say was wrong, and it got so bad that instead of responding and </span><span id="cant-line-703">skipping like scratched vinyl whenever the teacher called my name, I often </span><span id="cant-line-704">chose to keep quiet. It was all about limiting exposure to save  face. </span><span id="cant-line-705">Ms. D didn’ t even attempt to empathize. She went straight to frustration and </span><span id="cant-line-706">vented it by yelling at me, sometimes when she was leaning down, her hand </span><span id="cant-line-707">on the back of my chair , her face just inches from my own. She had no idea </span><span id="cant-line-708">the Pandora’ s box she was tearin g open. Once, school was a safe harbor , the </span><span id="cant-line-709">one place I knew I couldn’ t be hurt, but in Indiana it morph ed into my </span><span id="cant-line-710">torture  chamber . </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-711">Ms. D wanted me out of her classroom, and the administratio n supported </span><span id="cant-line-712">her until my mother fought for me. The principal agreed to keep me </span><span id="cant-line-713">enrolled if my mother signed off on time with a speech therapist and put me </span><span id="cant-line-714">into group therapy with a local shrink they  recommended. </span><span id="cant-line-715">The psychologist’ s office was adjacent to a hospital, which was exactly </span><span id="cant-line-716">where you’d want to put it if you were trying to make a little kid doubt </span><span id="cant-line-717">himself. It was like a bad movie. The shrink set up seven chairs in a </span><span id="cant-line-718">semicircle aroun d him, but some of the kids wouldn’ t or couldn’ t sit still. </span><span id="cant-line-719">One child wore a helmet and banged his head against the wall repeatedly . </span><span id="cant-line-720">Another kid stood up while the doctor was mid-sentence , walked toward a </span><span id="cant-line-721">far corner of the room, and pissed in the trash can. The kid sitting next to </span><span id="cant-line-722">me was the most normal person  in the group, and he had set his own house </span><span id="cant-line-723">on fire! I can remember staring  up at the shrink on my first day, thinking, </span><span id="cant-line-724">There’s no way I belong  here. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-725">That experience kicked my social anxiety up several notches. My stutter </span><span id="cant-line-726">was out of control. My hair started falling out, and white splotches bloomed </span><span id="cant-line-727">on my dark skin. The doctor diagnosed me as an ADHD case and </span><span id="cant-line-728">prescribed Ritalin, but my problems were more  complex. </span><span id="cant-line-729">I was suf fering from toxic  stress. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-730">The type of physical and emotio nal abuse I was exposed to has been proven </span><span id="cant-line-731">to have a range of side effects on young children because in our early yearsthe brain grows and develops so rapidly . If, during those years, your father </span><span id="cant-line-732">is an evil motherfucker hell-bent on destroying everyone in his house, stress </span><span id="cant-line-733">spikes, and when  those spikes occur frequently enough, you can draw a line </span><span id="cant-line-734">across the peak s. That’ s your new baseline. It puts kids in a permanent </span><span id="cant-line-735">“fight or flight” mode. Fight or flight can be a great tool when you’re in </span><span id="cant-line-736">danger because it amps you up to battle through or sprint from trouble, but </span><span id="cant-line-737">it’s no way to  live. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-738">I’m not the type of guy to try to explain everything with science, but facts </span><span id="cant-line-739">are facts. I’ve read that some pediatricians believe toxic stress does more </span><span id="cant-line-740">damage to kids than polio or meningitis. I know firsthand that it leads to </span><span id="cant-line-741">learning disabilities and social anxiety because according to doctors it limits </span><span id="cant-line-742">language development and memory , which makes it difficult for even the </span><span id="cant-line-743">most gifted student to recall what they have already learned. Looking at the </span><span id="cant-line-744">long game, when kids like me grow up, they face an increased risk for </span><span id="cant-line-745">clinical depress ion, heart disease, obesity , and cancer , not to mention </span><span id="cant-line-746">smoking, alcoholism, and drug abuse. Those raised in abusive households </span><span id="cant-line-747">have an increased probability of being arrested as a juvenile by 53 percent. </span><span id="cant-line-748">Their odds of committing a violent crime as an adult are increased by 38 </span><span id="cant-line-749">percent. I was the poster child of that generic term we’ve all heard before: </span><span id="cant-line-750">“at-risk youth.” My mother wasn’ t the one raising a thug. Look at the </span><span id="cant-line-751">numbers and it’s clear: if anyone put me on a destructive path it was </span><span id="cant-line-752">Trunnis  Goggins. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-753">I didn’t stay in group therapy for long, and I didn’ t take Ritalin  either . My </span><span id="cant-line-754">mom picked me up after my second session and I sat in the front seat of her </span><span id="cant-line-755">car wearing a thousand -yard stare. “Mom, I’m not going back,” I said. </span><span id="cant-line-756">“These boys are crazy .” She  agreed. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-757">But I was still a damaged kid, and while there are proven interventions on </span><span id="cant-line-758">the best way to teach and manage kids who suffer from toxic stress, it’s fair </span><span id="cant-line-759">to say that Ms. D didn’ t get those memos. I can’t blame her for her own </span><span id="cant-line-760">ignorance. The science wasn’ t nearly as clear in the 1980s as it is now. All I </span><span id="cant-line-761">know is, Sister Katherine toiled in the trenches with the same malformed </span><span id="cant-line-762">kid that Ms. D dealt with, but she maintained high expectation s and didn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-763">let her frustration overwhelm her. She had the mindset of, Look, everybody </span><span id="cant-line-764">learns in a differ ent way and we’re gonna figur e out how you learn . Shededuced that I needed repetition . That I needed to solve the same problems </span><span id="cant-line-765">over and over again in a dif ferent way to learn, and she knew that took time. </span><span id="cant-line-766">Ms. D was all about productiv ity. She was saying, Keep up or get out. </span><span id="cant-line-767">Meanwhile, I felt backed into a corner . I knew that if I didn’ t show some </span><span id="cant-line-768">improvement I would eventually be shipped out to that special black hole </span><span id="cant-line-769">for good, so I found a  solution. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-770">I started cheating my ass  off. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-771">Studying was hard, especially with my fucked -up brain, but I was a damn </span><span id="cant-line-772">good cheat. I copied friends’ homework and scanned my neighbors’ work </span><span id="cant-line-773">during tests. I even copied the answers on the standardized tests that didn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-774">have any impact on my grades. It worked! My rising test scores placated </span><span id="cant-line-775">Ms. D, and my mother stopped getting calls from school. I thought I’d </span><span id="cant-line-776">solved a problem when really I was creating new ones by taking the path of </span><span id="cant-line-777">least resistance. My coping mechanism confirmed that I would never learn </span><span id="cant-line-778">squat at school, and that I would never catch up, which pushed me closer </span><span id="cant-line-779">toward a flunked out  fate. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-780">The saving grace of those early years in Brazil was that I was way too </span><span id="cant-line-781">young to understand the kind of prejudice I would soon face in my new </span><span id="cant-line-782">hick hometown. Whenever you’re the only one of your kind, you’re in </span><span id="cant-line-783">danger of being pushed toward  the margins, suspected and disregarded, </span><span id="cant-line-784">bullied and mistreated by ignorant people. That’ s just the way life is, </span><span id="cant-line-785">especially back then, and by the time that reality kicked me in the throat, </span><span id="cant-line-786">my life had already become a full-fledged , fuck-you fortune cookie. </span><span id="cant-line-787">Whenever I cracked it open, I got the same  message. </span><span id="cant-line-788">You were born to  fail!CHALLENGE #1 </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-789">My bad cards arrived early and stuck around a while, but everyone gets </span><span id="cant-line-790">challenged in life at some point.

TRUTH HUR TS </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-816">WILMOTH  I RVING  WAS  A  NEW  BEGIN NING . U P  UNTIL  HE  MET  MY  MOTHER  AND  ASKED </span><span id="cant-line-817">for her phone number , all I’d known was misery and struggle. When the </span><span id="cant-line-818">money was good, our lives were defined by trauma. Once we were free of </span><span id="cant-line-819">my father , we were swept under by our own PTSD-level dysfunction and </span><span id="cant-line-820">poverty . Then, when I was in fourth grade, she met Wilmoth, a successful </span><span id="cant-line-821">carpenter and general contractor  from Indianapolis. She was attracted to his </span><span id="cant-line-822">easy smile and laid-back style. There was no violence in him. He gave us </span><span id="cant-line-823">permission to exhale. With him around it felt like we had some support, like </span><span id="cant-line-824">something good was finally happening to  us.With W ilmoth </span><span id="cant-line-825">She laughed when they were together . Her smile was bright and real. She </span><span id="cant-line-826">stood up a little straighter . He gave her pride and made her feel beautiful </span><span id="cant-line-827">again. As for me, Wilmoth became as close to a healthy father figure as I’ve </span><span id="cant-line-828">ever had. He didn’ t coddle me. He didn’ t tell me he loved me or any of that </span><span id="cant-line-829">fake-ass sappy shit, but he was there. Basketball had been an obsession of </span><span id="cant-line-830">mine since grade school. It was the core of my relationship with my best </span><span id="cant-line-831">friend, Johnny Nichols, and Wilmoth had game. He and I hit the courts </span><span id="cant-line-832">together all the time. He showed me moves, tuned up my defensive </span><span id="cant-line-833">discipline, and helped me deve lop a jump shot. The three of us celebrated </span><span id="cant-line-834">birthdays and holidays together , and the summer before eighth grade, he got </span><span id="cant-line-835">down on one knee and asked my mother to make it  official. </span><span id="cant-line-836">Wilmoth lived in Indianapolis, and our plan was to move in with him the </span><span id="cant-line-837">following summ er. Though he wasn’t nearly as rich as Trunni s, he made a </span><span id="cant-line-838">nice living and we looked forw ard to city life again. Then in 1989, the day </span><span id="cant-line-839">after Christmas, everything  stopped. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-840">We hadn’ t made the full time move to Indy yet, and he’d spent Christmas </span><span id="cant-line-841">Day with us at my grandparents’ place in Brazil. The next day, he had a </span><span id="cant-line-842">basketball game in his men’ s league and he’d invited me to sub for one of </span><span id="cant-line-843">his team mates. I was so excited I’d packed my bags two days early , but that </span><span id="cant-line-844">morning he told me I couldn’ t come after  all. </span><span id="cant-line-845">“I’m gonna keep you back here this time, Little David,” he said. I dropped </span><span id="cant-line-846">my head and sighed. He could  tell I was upset and tried to reassure me. </span><span id="cant-line-847">“Your mom is gonna drive up in a few days and we can play ball  then.” </span><span id="cant-line-848">I nodded, reluctantly , but I wasn ’t raised to pry into the affairs of adults and </span><span id="cant-line-849">knew I wasn’ t owed an explan ation or make -up game. My mother and I </span><span id="cant-line-850">watched from the front porch as he backed out of the carport, smiled, and </span><span id="cant-line-851">gave us that crisp single wave of his. Then he drove  off. </span><span id="cant-line-852">It was the last time we’d ever see him  alive. </span><span id="cant-line-853">He played in his men’ s league game that night, as planned, and drove home </span><span id="cant-line-854">alone to the “house with the white lions.” Whenever he gave directions to </span><span id="cant-line-855">friends, family , or delivery guys , that’s how he always described his ranch -style  house, its drive way framed by two white lion sculptures elevated on </span><span id="cant-line-856">pillars. He pulle d between them and into the garage where he could enter the </span><span id="cant-line-857">house directly , oblivious to the danger moving in from behind. He never did </span><span id="cant-line-858">close that garage  door. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-859">They’d been staking him out for hours, waiting for a window , and as he </span><span id="cant-line-860">climbed out from the driver ’s side door, they stepped from the shadows and </span><span id="cant-line-861">fired from close range. He was shot five times in the chest. When he dropped </span><span id="cant-line-862">to the floor of his garage, the gunman stepped over him and delivered a kill </span><span id="cant-line-863">shot right between his  eyes. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-864">Wilmoth’ s fathe r lived a few blocks away , and when he drove by the white </span><span id="cant-line-865">lions the next morning, he noticed his son’s garage door open and knew </span><span id="cant-line-866">something was wrong. He walked up the driveway and into the garage where </span><span id="cant-line-867">he sobbed over his dead  son. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-868">Wilmoth was just forty -three  years  old. </span><span id="cant-line-869">I was still at my grandmother ’s house when Wilmoth’ s mother called </span><span id="cant-line-870">moments later . She hung up and motioned me to her side to break the news. I </span><span id="cant-line-871">thought about my mom. Wilmoth had been her savior . She’d been coming </span><span id="cant-line-872">out of her shell,  opening up, ready to believe in good things. What would </span><span id="cant-line-873">this do to her? Would God ever give her a damn break? It started as a </span><span id="cant-line-874">simmer but within seconds my rage overwhelmed me. I broke free of my </span><span id="cant-line-875">grandmother , punched the refrigerator , and left a  dent. </span><span id="cant-line-876">We drove to our place to find my mother , who was already frantic because </span><span id="cant-line-877">she hadn’ t heard from Wilmoth. She called his house just before we arrived, </span><span id="cant-line-878">and when a detective picked up the phone it puzzled her, but she didn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-879">expect this. How could she? We saw her confusion as my grandmother </span><span id="cant-line-880">walked over , peeled the phone from her fingers, and sat her  down. </span><span id="cant-line-881">She didn’t belie ve us at first. Wilmoth was a prankster and this was just the </span><span id="cant-line-882">kind of fucked -up stunt he might try to pull off. Then she remembered he’d </span><span id="cant-line-883">been shot two months before.  He’d told her the guys who’d done that </span><span id="cant-line-884">weren’ t after him. That those bullets were meant for someo ne else, and </span><span id="cant-line-885">because they merely grazed him, she decided to forget abou t the whole </span><span id="cant-line-886">thing. Until that moment, she never suspected that Wilmoth had some secretstreet life she knew nothing about, and the police never did find out exactly </span><span id="cant-line-887">why he was shot and killed. The speculation was that he was involved in a </span><span id="cant-line-888">shady business deal or a drug deal gone bad. My mother was still in denial </span><span id="cant-line-889">when she packed a bag, but she included a dress for his  funeral. </span><span id="cant-line-890">When we arrived, his house was wrapped in a ribbon of yellow police tape </span><span id="cant-line-891">like a fucked -up Christmas gift. This was no prank. My mom parked, ducked </span><span id="cant-line-892">under the tape, and I followed right behind her to the front door. On the way, </span><span id="cant-line-893">I remember glancing to my left trying to get a glimpse of the scene where </span><span id="cant-line-894">Wilmoth had been killed. His cold blood was still pooled on the garage floor . </span><span id="cant-line-895">I was a fourteen -year-old wandering through an active crime scene, but </span><span id="cant-line-896">nobody , not my mother , not Wilmoth’ s family , and not even the police </span><span id="cant-line-897">seemed disturbe d by me being there, absorbing the heavy vibe of my would - </span><span id="cant-line-898">be stepfather ’s murder . </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-899">As fucke d up as it sounds, the police allowed my mom to stay in Wilmoth’ s </span><span id="cant-line-900">house that night. Rather than stay alone, she had her brother -in-law there, </span><span id="cant-line-901">armed with his two guns in case the killers came back. I wound up in a back </span><span id="cant-line-902">bedroom at Wilmoth’ s sister ’s place, a dark and spooky house  a few miles </span><span id="cant-line-903">away , and left alone all night. The house was furnished with one of those </span><span id="cant-line-904">analog, cabinet television sets with thirteen channels on a dial. Only three </span><span id="cant-line-905">channels came in static -free, and I kept it on the local news. They ran the </span><span id="cant-line-906">same tape on a loop every thirty minutes: footage of my mom and me </span><span id="cant-line-907">ducking under police tape then watching Wilmoth get wheeled on a gurney </span><span id="cant-line-908">toward a waiting ambulance, a sheet over his  body . </span><span id="cant-line-909">It was like a horror scene. I sat there all alone, watching the same footage </span><span id="cant-line-910">over and over. My mind was a broken record that kept skipping into </span><span id="cant-line-911">darkness. The past had been bleak and now our sky-blue future had been </span><span id="cant-line-912">blown the fuck up too. There would be no reprieve, only my familiar fucked - </span><span id="cant-line-913">up reality choking  out all light. Each time I watched, my fear grew until it </span><span id="cant-line-914">filled the room, and still I could not  stop. </span><span id="cant-line-915">A few days after we buried Wilmoth, and just after the new year, I boarded a </span><span id="cant-line-916">school bus in Brazil, Indiana. I was still grieving, and my head was spinning </span><span id="cant-line-917">because my mother and I hadn’ t decided whether or not we were staying in </span><span id="cant-line-918">Brazil or moving to Indianapolis as planned. We were in limbo and she </span><span id="cant-line-919">remained in a state of shock. She still hadn’ t cried over Wilmoth’s death.Instead she became emotionally vacant again. It was as if all the pain she’d </span><span id="cant-line-920">experienced in her life resurface d as one gaping wound she disappeared into, </span><span id="cant-line-921">and there was no reaching her in that void. In the meantime,  school was </span><span id="cant-line-922">starting up, so I played along, looking for any shred of normal I could hang </span><span id="cant-line-923">onto. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-924">But it was hard. I rode a bus to school most days, and my first day back, I </span><span id="cant-line-925">couldn’ t shake a memory I’d buried from the year before. That morning, I </span><span id="cant-line-926">slid into a seat above the back left tire overlooking the street as usual. When </span><span id="cant-line-927">we arrived at school the bus pulled up to the curb, we needed to wait for the </span><span id="cant-line-928">ones ahead of us to move before we could get off. In the meantime, a car </span><span id="cant-line-929">pulled alongside us, and a cute, overeager little boy ran toward our bus </span><span id="cant-line-930">carrying a platter of cookies. The driver didn’ t see him. The bus jerked </span><span id="cant-line-931">forward. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-932">I noticed  the alarmed look on his mother ’s face before the sudden crush of </span><span id="cant-line-933">blood splattered  my window . His mother howled in horror . She wasn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-934">among us anym ore. She looked and sounded like a fierce, wounded animal </span><span id="cant-line-935">as she literally pulled the hair from her head by the roots. Soon sirens wailed </span><span id="cant-line-936">in the distance and screamed closer by the second. The little boy was about </span><span id="cant-line-937">six years old. The cookies were a present for the  driver . </span><span id="cant-line-938">We were all ordered off the bus, and as I walked by the trage dy, for some </span><span id="cant-line-939">reason—call it human curiosity , call it the magnetic pull of dark to dark—I </span><span id="cant-line-940">peeked under the bus and saw him. His head was nearly as flat as paper , his </span><span id="cant-line-941">brains and blood mingled under the carriage like spent  oil. </span><span id="cant-line-942">For a full year I hadn’ t thought of that image even once, but Wilmoth’ s death </span><span id="cant-line-943">reawakened it, and now it was all I could think about. I was beyond the pale. </span><span id="cant-line-944">Nothing mattere d to me. I’d seen enough to know that the world was filled </span><span id="cant-line-945">with human tragedy and that it would just keep piling up in drifts until it </span><span id="cant-line-946">swallowed  me. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-947">I couldn’t sleep in bed anymore. Neither could my mother . She slept in her </span><span id="cant-line-948">arm chair with the television on blast or with a book in her hands. For a little </span><span id="cant-line-949">while, I tried to curl up in bed at night but would always wake in the fetal </span><span id="cant-line-950">position on the floor . Eventually I gave in and bedded down low to theground. Maybe because I knew if I could find comfort at the bottom place </span><span id="cant-line-951">there would be no more  falling. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-952">We were two people in dire need of the fresh start we thought we had </span><span id="cant-line-953">coming, so even without Wilmoth, we made the move to Indianapolis. My </span><span id="cant-line-954">mother set me up for entry exams at Cathedral High School, a private </span><span id="cant-line-955">college preparatory academy in the heart of the city. As usual, I cheated, and </span><span id="cant-line-956">off a smart moth erfucker too. When my acceptance letter and class schedule </span><span id="cant-line-957">came in the mail the summer before freshman year, I was looking at a full </span><span id="cant-line-958">slate of AP  classes! </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-959">I hacked my way through, cheating and copying, and managed  to make the </span><span id="cant-line-960">freshman basketball team, which was one of the best freshman teams in the </span><span id="cant-line-961">entire state. We had several future college players, and I started at point </span><span id="cant-line-962">guard. That was a confidence boost, but not the kind I could build on </span><span id="cant-line-963">because I knew I was an academic fraud. Plus, the school cost my mom way </span><span id="cant-line-964">too much money , so after only one year at Cathedral, she pulled the  plug. </span><span id="cant-line-965">I started my sophomore year at North Central High School, a public school </span><span id="cant-line-966">with 4,000 kids in a majority black neighborhood, and on my first day I </span><span id="cant-line-967">turned up like some preppy -ass white boy. My jeans were definitely too </span><span id="cant-line-968">tight, and my collared shirt was tucked into a waistline cinched with a </span><span id="cant-line-969">braided belt. The only reason I didn’ t get completely laughe d out of the </span><span id="cant-line-970">building was because I could  ball. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-971">My soph omore year was all about being cool. I switched up my wardrobe, </span><span id="cant-line-972">which was increasingly influenced by hip hop culture, and hung out with </span><span id="cant-line-973">gang bangers and other borderli ne delinquents, which meant I didn’t always </span><span id="cant-line-974">go to school. One day, my mom came home in the middle of the day and </span><span id="cant-line-975">found me sitting around our dining room table with what she described as </span><span id="cant-line-976">“ten thugs.” She wasn’ t wrong. Within a few weeks she packed us up and </span><span id="cant-line-977">moved us back to Brazil, Indiana. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-978">I enrolle d at Northview High School the week of basketball tryouts, and I </span><span id="cant-line-979">remember show ing up at lunch time when the cafeteria was full. There were </span><span id="cant-line-980">1,200 kids enrolled at Northview , only five of which were black, and the last </span><span id="cant-line-981">time any of them had seen me I looked a lot like them. Not  anymore.I strolled into school that day wearing pants five sizes too big and sagged </span><span id="cant-line-982">way down low. I also wore an oversized Chicago Bulls Jacket with a </span><span id="cant-line-983">backward hat, cocked to the side. Within seconds, all eyes were upon me. </span><span id="cant-line-984">Teachers, studen ts, and administrative staff stared at me like I was some </span><span id="cant-line-985">exotic species. I was the first thuggish black kid many of them had seen in </span><span id="cant-line-986">real life. My mere presence had stopped the music. I was the needle being </span><span id="cant-line-987">dragged across vinyl, scratching a whole new rhythm, and like hip hop itself, </span><span id="cant-line-988">everybody notic ed but not every one liked what they heard. I strutted through </span><span id="cant-line-989">the scene like I gave no  fucks. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-990">But that was a lie. I acted all kinds of cocky and my entrance was brash as </span><span id="cant-line-991">hell, but I felt very insecure going back there. Buffalo had been like living in </span><span id="cant-line-992">a blazing  inferno. My early years in Brazil were a perfect incubator for post </span><span id="cant-line-993">traumatic stress , and before I left I was delivered a double dose of death </span><span id="cant-line-994">trauma. Moving to Indianapolis  had been an opportunity to escape pity and </span><span id="cant-line-995">leave all that behind. Class wasn’ t easy for me, but I’d made friends and </span><span id="cant-line-996">developed a new style. Now , coming back, I looked different enough on the </span><span id="cant-line-997">outside to perpetuate an illusion  that I’d changed, but in order to change you </span><span id="cant-line-998">have to work through shit. Confront it and get real. I hadn’ t done a shred of </span><span id="cant-line-999">that hard work. I was still a dumb kid with nothing solid to lean on, and </span><span id="cant-line-1000">basketball tryouts ripped away any confidence I had  left. </span><span id="cant-line-1001">When I got to the gym, they made me suit-up in uniform rather than wear </span><span id="cant-line-1002">my more generi c gym clothes. Back then the style was getting baggy and </span><span id="cant-line-1003">oversized, which Chris Webber and Jalen Rose of the Fab Five would make </span><span id="cant-line-1004">famous at the University of Michigan. The coaches in Brazil didn’ t have </span><span id="cant-line-1005">their fingers on that pulse. They put me in the tighty -whitey  version of </span><span id="cant-line-1006">basketball short s, which strangled my balls, hugged my thighs super tight, </span><span id="cant-line-1007">and felt all kinds of wrong. I was trapped in the coaches’ preferred dream </span><span id="cant-line-1008">state: a Larry Bird time warp. Which made sense because Larry Legend was </span><span id="cant-line-1009">basically a patron saint in Brazil and all of Indiana. In fact, his daughter went </span><span id="cant-line-1010">to our school. We were friends.  But that didn’ t mean I wanted to dress like </span><span id="cant-line-1011">him! </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1012">Then there was my etiquette. In Indianapolis the coaches let us talk shit on </span><span id="cant-line-1013">the court. If I made a good move or hit a shot in your face, I talked about </span><span id="cant-line-1014">your mama or your girlfriend. In Indy , I’d done research on my shit talking. I </span><span id="cant-line-1015">got good at it. I was the Draymo nd Green of my school, and it was all part ofbasketball culture in the city. Back in farm country , that cost me. When </span><span id="cant-line-1016">tryouts started, I handled the rock a bunch, and when I crossed some of the </span><span id="cant-line-1017">kids over and made them look bad I let them and the coache s know . My </span><span id="cant-line-1018">attitude embarrassed the coaches (who were apparently ignorant that their </span><span id="cant-line-1019">hero, Larry Legend, was an all-time great trash talker), and it wasn ’t long </span><span id="cant-line-1020">before they took the ball out of my hands and put me in the front court, a </span><span id="cant-line-1021">position I’d never played before. I was uncomfortable down low, and played </span><span id="cant-line-1022">like it. That shut me up good. Meanwhile, Johnny was  dominating. </span><span id="cant-line-1023">My only saving grace that week was getting back with Johnny Nichols. </span><span id="cant-line-1024">We’d stayed close while I was away and our marathon one-on-one battles </span><span id="cant-line-1025">were back on full swing. Though he was undersized, he was always a nice </span><span id="cant-line-1026">player and he was one of the best on the floor during tryouts. He was </span><span id="cant-line-1027">draining shots, seeing the open man, and running the court. It was no </span><span id="cant-line-1028">surprise when he made the varsity squad, but we were both shocked that I </span><span id="cant-line-1029">barely made  JV. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1030">I was crushed. And not because of basketball tryouts. To me that outcome </span><span id="cant-line-1031">was another symptom of something else I’d been feeling. Braz il looked the </span><span id="cant-line-1032">same, but shit felt different this time around. Grade school had been hard </span><span id="cant-line-1033">academically , but even though we were one of only a few black families in </span><span id="cant-line-1034">town, I didn’ t notice or feel any palpable racism. As a teenager I experienced </span><span id="cant-line-1035">it every where, and it wasn’ t because I’d become ultra sensitive. Outright </span><span id="cant-line-1036">racism had always  been  there. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1037">Not long after moving back to Brazil, my cousin Damien and I went to a </span><span id="cant-line-1038">party way out in the country . We stayed out well past curfew . In fact, we </span><span id="cant-line-1039">were up all night long, and after daybreak we called our grand mother for a </span><span id="cant-line-1040">ride home. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1041">“Excuse me?” She asked. “You disobeyed me, so you may as well start </span><span id="cant-line-1042">walking.” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1043">Roger  that. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1044">She lived ten miles away , down  a long country road, but we joked around </span><span id="cant-line-1045">and enjoyed ourselves as we started to stroll. Damien lived in Indianapolis </span><span id="cant-line-1046">and we were both sagging our baggy jeans and dressed in oversized Starterjackets, not exactly typical gear on Brazil’ s country roads. We’d walked </span><span id="cant-line-1047">seven miles in a few hours when a pick-up truck came bouncing down the </span><span id="cant-line-1048">tarmac in our direction. We edged to the side of the road to let it pass, but it </span><span id="cant-line-1049">slowed down, and as it crept past us, we could see two teenage rs in the cab </span><span id="cant-line-1050">and a third standing in the bed of the truck. The passenger pointed and yelled </span><span id="cant-line-1051">through his open  window . </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1052">“Niggers!” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1053">We didn’t overr eact. We put our heads down and kept walking at the same </span><span id="cant-line-1054">pace, until we heard that beat-to-shit truck squeal to a stop on a patch of </span><span id="cant-line-1055">gravel, and kick up a dust storm. That’ s when I turned and saw the </span><span id="cant-line-1056">passenger , a scruf fy looking redneck, exit the cab of the truck with a pistol in </span><span id="cant-line-1057">his hand. He aimed it at my head as he stalked toward  me. </span><span id="cant-line-1058">“Where the fuck you from, and why the fuck you here in this fucking </span><span id="cant-line-1059">town?!” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1060">Damien eased down the road, while I locked eyes with the gunman and said </span><span id="cant-line-1061">nothing. He stepped within two feet of me. The threat of violenc e doesn’ t get </span><span id="cant-line-1062">much more real than that. Chills rippled my skin, but I refus ed to run or </span><span id="cant-line-1063">cower . After a few seconds he got back in the truck and they sped  off. </span><span id="cant-line-1064">It wasn’ t the first time I’d heard the word. Not long before that I was </span><span id="cant-line-1065">hanging out in Pizza Hut with Johnny and a couple of girls,  including a </span><span id="cant-line-1066">brunette I liked, named Pam. She liked me too, but we’d never acted on it. </span><span id="cant-line-1067">We were two innocents enjoying one another ’s company , but when her father </span><span id="cant-line-1068">arrived to take her home he caught sight of us, and when Pam saw him, her </span><span id="cant-line-1069">face went ghost  white. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1070">He burst into the packed restaurant and stalked toward us with all eyes on </span><span id="cant-line-1071">him. He never addressed me. He just locked eyes with her and said, “I don’t </span><span id="cant-line-1072">want to ever see you sitting with this nigger  again.” </span><span id="cant-line-1073">She hustled out the door after him, her face red with shame as I sat, </span><span id="cant-line-1074">paralyzed, starin g at the floor . It was the most humiliating moment of my </span><span id="cant-line-1075">life, and it hurt much more than the gun incident because it happened in </span><span id="cant-line-1076">public, and the word had been  spewed by a grown -ass man. I couldn’ tunderstand how or why he was filled with so much hate, and if he felt that </span><span id="cant-line-1077">way, how many other people in Brazil shared his point of view when they </span><span id="cant-line-1078">saw me walking down the street? It was the sort of riddle you didn’ t want to </span><span id="cant-line-1079">solve. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1080">*** </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1081">They won’t call on me if they can’t see me. That was how I operated during </span><span id="cant-line-1082">my sophomore year in high school in Brazil, Indiana. I would hide out in the </span><span id="cant-line-1083">back rows, slump low in my chair , and sidestep my way through each and </span><span id="cant-line-1084">every class. Our high school made us take a foreign language that year, </span><span id="cant-line-1085">which was funny to me. Not because I couldn’ t see the value, but because I </span><span id="cant-line-1086">could barely read English, let alone understand Spanish. By then, after a </span><span id="cant-line-1087">good eight years of cheating, my ignorance had crystalized. I kept leveling </span><span id="cant-line-1088">up in school, on track, but hadn’ t learned a damn thing. I was one of those </span><span id="cant-line-1089">kids who though t he was gaming the system when, the whole time, I’d been </span><span id="cant-line-1090">gaming  myself. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1091">One morning, about halfway through the school year, I milled into Spanish </span><span id="cant-line-1092">class and grabbed my workbook  from a back cupboard. There was technique </span><span id="cant-line-1093">involved in skating by. You didn’t have to pay attention, but you did have to </span><span id="cant-line-1094">make it seem like you were, so I slumped into my seat, opened up my </span><span id="cant-line-1095">workbook, and fixed my gaze on the teacher who lectured from  the front of </span><span id="cant-line-1096">the room. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1097">When I looked down at the page  the whole room went silent. At least to me. </span><span id="cant-line-1098">Her lips were still moving, but I couldn’ t hear because my attention had </span><span id="cant-line-1099">narrowed on the message left for me, and me  alone. </span><span id="cant-line-1100">We each had our own assigned workbook in that class, and my name was </span><span id="cant-line-1101">written in pencil at the top right corner of the title page. That’ s how they </span><span id="cant-line-1102">knew it was mine. Below that, someone had drawn an image of me in a </span><span id="cant-line-1103">noose. It looked rudimentary , like something out of the hangm an game we </span><span id="cant-line-1104">used to play as kids. Below that were the  words. </span><span id="cant-line-1105">Niger we’r e gonna kill  you!They’d misspell ed it, but I had no clue. I could barely spell myself, and </span><span id="cant-line-1106">they’d made their fucking point. I looked around the room as my rage </span><span id="cant-line-1107">gathered like a typhoon until it was literally buzzing in my ears. I’m not </span><span id="cant-line-1108">supposed to be here, I thought to myself. I’m not supposed to be back in </span><span id="cant-line-1109">Brazil! </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1110">I took inventory  of all the incidents I’d already experienced and decided I </span><span id="cant-line-1111">couldn’ t take much more. The teacher was still talking when I rose up </span><span id="cant-line-1112">without warning . She called my name but I wasn’ t trying to hear. I left the </span><span id="cant-line-1113">classroom, notebook in hand, and bolted to the principal’ s office. I was so </span><span id="cant-line-1114">enraged I didn’ t even stop at the front desk. I walked right into his office and </span><span id="cant-line-1115">dropped the evidence on his  desk. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1116">“I’m tired of this shit,” I  said. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1117">Kirk Freeman was the principal at that time, and to this day he still </span><span id="cant-line-1118">remembers looking up from his desk and seeing tears in my eyes. It wasn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-1119">some mystery why all this shit was happening in Brazil. Southern Indiana </span><span id="cant-line-1120">had always  been a hotbed of racists, and he knew it. Four years later, in </span><span id="cant-line-1121">1995, the Ku Klux Klan would march down Brazil’ s main drag on </span><span id="cant-line-1122">Independence Day, in full hood ed regalia. The KKK was active in Center </span><span id="cant-line-1123">Point, a town located not fifteen  minutes away , and kids from there went to </span><span id="cant-line-1124">our school. Some of them sat behind me in history class and told racist jokes </span><span id="cant-line-1125">for my benefit nearly every damn day. I wasn’ t expecting some investigation </span><span id="cant-line-1126">into who did it. More than anything, in that moment, I was looking for some </span><span id="cant-line-1127">compassion, and I could tell from the look in Principal Freeman’ s eyes he </span><span id="cant-line-1128">felt bad about what I was going through, but he was at a loss. He didn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-1129">know how to help me. Instead, he examined the drawing and the message for </span><span id="cant-line-1130">a long beat, then raised his eyes to mine, ready to console me with his words </span><span id="cant-line-1131">of wisdom. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1132">“David, this is sheer ignorance ,” he said. “They don’t even know how to </span><span id="cant-line-1133">spell  nigger .” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1134">My life had been threatened, and that was the best he could do. The </span><span id="cant-line-1135">loneliness I felt leaving his office is something I’ll never forget. It was scary </span><span id="cant-line-1136">to think  that there was so much hate flowing through the halls and that </span><span id="cant-line-1137">someone I didn’ t even know wanted me dead because of the color of myskin. The same question kept looping through my mind: Who the fuck is out </span><span id="cant-line-1138">here who hates me like this? I had no idea who my enemy was. Was it one of </span><span id="cant-line-1139">the rednecks from history class , or was it somebody I thought I was cool </span><span id="cant-line-1140">with but who really didn’ t like me at all? It was one thing staring down the </span><span id="cant-line-1141">barrel of a gun on the street or dealing with some racist parent. At least that </span><span id="cant-line-1142">shit was honest. Wondering who else felt that way in my school was a </span><span id="cant-line-1143">different kind of unnerving, and I couldn’ t shake it off. Even though I had </span><span id="cant-line-1144">plenty of friends, all of them white, I couldn’ t stop seeing the hidden racism </span><span id="cant-line-1145">scrawled all over the walls in invisible ink, which made it extremely hard to </span><span id="cant-line-1146">carry the weight of being the only. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1147">KKK in Center Point in 1995—Center Point is fifteen minutes from my house in Brazil </span><span id="cant-line-1148">Most, if not all, minorities, women, and gay people in America know that </span><span id="cant-line-1149">strain of loneliness well. Of walking into rooms where you are the only one </span><span id="cant-line-1150">of your kind. Most white men have no idea how hard it can be. I wish they </span><span id="cant-line-1151">did. Because then they’d know how it drains you. How some days, all youwant to do is stay home and wallow because to go public is to be completely </span><span id="cant-line-1152">exposed, vulner able to a world  that tracks and judges you. At least that’s </span><span id="cant-line-1153">how it feels. The truth is, you can’t tell for sure when or if that is actually </span><span id="cant-line-1154">happening in a given moment. But it often feels like it, which is its own kind </span><span id="cant-line-1155">of mindfuck. In Brazil, I was the only  everywhere I went. At my table in the </span><span id="cant-line-1156">cafeteria, where I chilled at lunch with Johnny and our crew . In every class I </span><span id="cant-line-1157">took. Even in the damn basketball  gym. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1158">By the end of that year I turned sixteen and my grandfather bought me a </span><span id="cant-line-1159">used, doo-doo brown Chevy Citation. One of the first mornings I ever drove </span><span id="cant-line-1160">it to school, someone spray painted the word “nigger” on my driver ’s side </span><span id="cant-line-1161">door. This time they spelled it correctly and Principal Freeman was again at </span><span id="cant-line-1162">a loss for words. The fury that churned within me that day was </span><span id="cant-line-1163">indescribable, but it didn’ t radiate out. It broke me down from within </span><span id="cant-line-1164">because I hadn’ t yet learned what to do or where to channel that much </span><span id="cant-line-1165">emotion. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1166">Was I supposed to fight everybody? I’d been suspended from school three </span><span id="cant-line-1167">times for fighting, and by now I was almost numb. Instead, I withdrew and </span><span id="cant-line-1168">fell into the well of black natio nalism. Malcolm X became my prophet of </span><span id="cant-line-1169">choice. I used to come home from school and watch the same video of one </span><span id="cant-line-1170">of his early speeches every damn day. I was trying to find comfort </span><span id="cant-line-1171">somewhere, and the way he analyzed history and spun black hopelessness </span><span id="cant-line-1172">into rage nourished me, though most of his political and economic </span><span id="cant-line-1173">philosophies went over my head. It was his anger at a system made by and </span><span id="cant-line-1174">for white people that I connected with because I lived in a haze of hate, </span><span id="cant-line-1175">trapped in my own fruitless rage and ignorance. But I wasn’ t Nation of Islam </span><span id="cant-line-1176">material. That shit took discipline, and I had none of  that. </span><span id="cant-line-1177">Instead, by my junior year, I went out of my way to piss people off by </span><span id="cant-line-1178">becoming the exact stereotype racist white people loathed and feared. I wore </span><span id="cant-line-1179">my pants down below my ass every day. I ghetto wired my car stereo to </span><span id="cant-line-1180">house speakers which filled the trunk of my Citation. I rattled windows </span><span id="cant-line-1181">when I cruised down Brazil’ s main drag blasting Snoop’ s Gin and Juice . I </span><span id="cant-line-1182">put three of those shag carpet covers over my steering wheel and dangled a </span><span id="cant-line-1183">pair of fuzzy dice from the rearview . Every morning before school I stared </span><span id="cant-line-1184">into our bathroo m mirror and came up with new ways to fuck with the </span><span id="cant-line-1185">racists at my  school.I even concocted wild hairdos. Once, I gave myself a reverse part—shaving </span><span id="cant-line-1186">away all my hair save a thin radial line on the left side of my scalp. It wasn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-1187">that I was unpopular . I was considered the cool black kid in town, but if </span><span id="cant-line-1188">you’d have bothered to drill down a little deeper , you’d see that I wasn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-1189">about black culture and that my antics weren’ t really trying  to call out </span><span id="cant-line-1190">racism. I wasn’ t about anything at  all. </span><span id="cant-line-1191">Everything I did was to get a reaction out of the people who hated me most </span><span id="cant-line-1192">because everyon e’s opinion of me mattered to me, and that’s a shallow way </span><span id="cant-line-1193">to live. I was full of pain, had no real purpose, and if you were watching </span><span id="cant-line-1194">from afar it would have looked like I’d given up on any chanc e of success. </span><span id="cant-line-1195">That I was heading for disaster . But I hadn’ t let go of all hope. I had one </span><span id="cant-line-1196">more dream  left. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1197">I wanted to join the Air  Force. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1198">My grandfather had been a cook  in the Air Force for thirty -seven  years, and </span><span id="cant-line-1199">he was so proud of his service that even after he retired he’d wear his dress </span><span id="cant-line-1200">uniform to church on Sundays, and his work -a-day uniform midweek just to </span><span id="cant-line-1201">sit on the damn porch. That level of pride inspired me to join the Civil Air </span><span id="cant-line-1202">Patrol, the civilian auxiliary of the Air Force. We met once a week, marched </span><span id="cant-line-1203">in forma tion, and learned about the various jobs available in the Air Force </span><span id="cant-line-1204">from officers, which is how I became fascinated with Pararescu e—the guys </span><span id="cant-line-1205">who jump out of airplanes to pull downed pilots out of harm’ s way. </span><span id="cant-line-1206">I attended a week -long course during the summer before my freshman year </span><span id="cant-line-1207">called PJOC, the Pararescue Jump Orientation Course. As usual, I was the </span><span id="cant-line-1208">only. One day a pararescuman named Scott Gearen came to speak, and he </span><span id="cant-line-1209">had a motherfucker of a story to tell. During a standard exercise, on a high </span><span id="cant-line-1210">altitude jump from 13,000 feet, Gearen deployed his chute with another </span><span id="cant-line-1211">skydiver right above him. That wasn’ t out of the ordinary . He had the right </span><span id="cant-line-1212">of way, and per his training, he’d waved off the other jumper . Except the guy </span><span id="cant-line-1213">didn’ t see him, which placed Gearen in grave danger because  the jumper </span><span id="cant-line-1214">above him was still mid free-fall, hurtling through the air at over 120 mph. </span><span id="cant-line-1215">He went into a cannonball hoping to avoid clipping Gearen, but it didn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-1216">work. Gearen had no clue what was coming when his teammate flew </span><span id="cant-line-1217">through his canopy , collapsing it on contact, and slammed into Gearen’ s face </span><span id="cant-line-1218">with his knees. Gearen was knocked unconscious instantly and wobbled intoanother free fall, his crushed chute creating very little drag. The other </span><span id="cant-line-1219">skydiver was able to deploy his chute and survive with minor  injuries. </span><span id="cant-line-1220">Gearen didn’t really land. He bounced like a flat basketball, three times, but </span><span id="cant-line-1221">because he’d been unconscious, his body was limp, and he didn’ t come apart </span><span id="cant-line-1222">despite crashing into the ground at 100 mph. He died twice on the operating </span><span id="cant-line-1223">table, but the ER docs brought him back to life. When he woke in a hospital </span><span id="cant-line-1224">bed, they said he wouldn’ t make a full recovery and would never be a </span><span id="cant-line-1225">pararescuman again. Eighteen months later he’d defied medical odds, made </span><span id="cant-line-1226">that full recovery , and was back on the job he  loved. </span><span id="cant-line-1227">Scott Gearen after his accident </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1228">For years I was obsessed with that story because he’d survived the </span><span id="cant-line-1229">impossible, and I resonated with his survival. After Wilmoth’ s murder , with </span><span id="cant-line-1230">all those racist taunts raining down on my head (I won’ t bore you with everysingle episode, just know there were many more), I felt like I was free falling </span><span id="cant-line-1231">with no fucking chute. Gearen was living proof that it’s possible to transcend </span><span id="cant-line-1232">anything that doesn’ t kill you, and from the time I heard him speak I knew I </span><span id="cant-line-1233">would enlist in the Air Force after graduation, which only made school seem </span><span id="cant-line-1234">more  irrelevant. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1235">Especially after I was cut from the varsity basketball team during my junior </span><span id="cant-line-1236">year. I wasn’ t cut because of my skills. The coaches knew I was one of the </span><span id="cant-line-1237">best players they had, and that I loved the game. Johnny and I played it night </span><span id="cant-line-1238">and day. Our entire friendship was based on basketball, but because I was </span><span id="cant-line-1239">angry at the coaches for how they used me on the JV team the year before, I </span><span id="cant-line-1240">didn’ t attend summer workouts, and they took that as a lack of commitment </span><span id="cant-line-1241">to the team. They didn’ t know or care that when they cut me, they’d </span><span id="cant-line-1242">eliminated any incentive I’d had to keep my GPA up, which I’d barely </span><span id="cant-line-1243">managed to do through cheating anyway . Now , I had no good reason to </span><span id="cant-line-1244">attend school. At least that’s what I thought, because I was clueless about the </span><span id="cant-line-1245">emphasis that the military places on education. I figured they’d take </span><span id="cant-line-1246">anybody . Two incidents convinced me otherwise and inspired me to  change. </span><span id="cant-line-1247">The first was when I failed the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery </span><span id="cant-line-1248">test (ASVAB) during my junior year. The ASVAB is the armed forces </span><span id="cant-line-1249">version of the SATs. It’s a standardized test that allows the milit ary to assess </span><span id="cant-line-1250">your current knowledge and future potential for learning at the same time, </span><span id="cant-line-1251">and I showed up for that test prepared to do what I did best: cheat. I’d been </span><span id="cant-line-1252">copying on every test, in every class, for years, but when I took my seat for </span><span id="cant-line-1253">the ASVAB I was shocked to see that the people seated to my right and left </span><span id="cant-line-1254">had different tests than I did. I had to go it alone and scored a 20 out of a </span><span id="cant-line-1255">possible 99 points. The absolute minimum standard to be admitted to the Air </span><span id="cant-line-1256">Force is only 36, and I couldn’ t even get  there. </span><span id="cant-line-1257">The second sign that I needed to change arrived with a postmar k just before </span><span id="cant-line-1258">school let out for the summer after junior year. My mother was still in her </span><span id="cant-line-1259">emotional black hole after Wilmoth’ s murder , and her coping mechanism </span><span id="cant-line-1260">was to take on as much as possible. She worked full-time at DePauw </span><span id="cant-line-1261">University and taught night classes at Indiana State University because if she </span><span id="cant-line-1262">stopped hustling long enough to think, she would realize the reality of her </span><span id="cant-line-1263">life. She kept it moving, was never around, and never asked to see my </span><span id="cant-line-1264">grades. After the first semester of our junior year, I remember Johnny andme bringing home Fs and Ds. We spent two hours doctoring the ink. We </span><span id="cant-line-1265">turned Fs into Bs and Ds into Cs, and were laughing the whole damn time. I </span><span id="cant-line-1266">actually rememb er feeling a perverse pride in being able to show my fake </span><span id="cant-line-1267">grades to my mother , but she never even asked to see them. She took my </span><span id="cant-line-1268">damn word for  it. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1269">Junior year transcript </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1270">We lived parallel lives in the same house, and since I was more or less </span><span id="cant-line-1271">raising myself, I stopped listening to her. In fact, about ten days before the </span><span id="cant-line-1272">letter arrived, she’d kicked me out because I refused to come home from a </span><span id="cant-line-1273">party before curfew . She told me that if I didn’ t, I shouldn’ t come home at </span><span id="cant-line-1274">all. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1275">In my mind, I had already been living by myself for several years. I made </span><span id="cant-line-1276">my own meals, cleaned my own clothes. I wasn’ t angry at her. I was cocky </span><span id="cant-line-1277">and figured I didn’t need her anymore. I stayed out that night, and for the </span><span id="cant-line-1278">next week and a half I crashed at Johnny’ s place or with other friends. </span><span id="cant-line-1279">Eventually the day came when  I’d spent my last dollar . By chance, she </span><span id="cant-line-1280">called me at Johnny’ s that morn ing and told me about a letter from school. It </span><span id="cant-line-1281">said I’d missed over a quarter of the year due to unexcused absences, that I </span><span id="cant-line-1282">had a D average, and unless I showed significant improvement in my GPA </span><span id="cant-line-1283">and attendance during my senior year, I would not graduate. She wasn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-1284">emotional about it. She was more exhausted than  exasperated. </span><span id="cant-line-1285">“I’ll come home and get the note,” I  said.“No need for that,” she replie d, “I just wanted you to know you were </span><span id="cant-line-1286">flunking  out.” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1287">I showed up on her doorstep later that day with my stomach  growling. I </span><span id="cant-line-1288">didn’ t ask for for giveness and she didn’ t demand an apology . She just left the </span><span id="cant-line-1289">door open and walked away . I stepped into the kitchen and made myself a </span><span id="cant-line-1290">peanut butter and jelly sandwich. She passed me the letter without saying a </span><span id="cant-line-1291">word. I read it in my room wher e the walls were papered over with layers of </span><span id="cant-line-1292">Michael Jordan  and special ops posters. Inspiration for twin passions </span><span id="cant-line-1293">slipping through my  fingers. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1294">That night, after taking a shower , I wiped the steam away from our corroded </span><span id="cant-line-1295">bathroom mirror and took a good look. I didn’ t like who I saw staring back. I </span><span id="cant-line-1296">was a low-budget  thug with no purpose and no future. I felt so disgusted I </span><span id="cant-line-1297">wanted to punch that motherfucker in the face and shatter glass. Instead, I </span><span id="cant-line-1298">lectured him. It was time to get  real. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1299">“Look at you,” I said. “Why do you think the Air Force wants your punk </span><span id="cant-line-1300">ass? Y ou stand for nothing. Y ou are an  embarrassment.” </span><span id="cant-line-1301">I reached for the shaving cream, smoothed a thin coat over my face, </span><span id="cant-line-1302">unwrapped a fresh razor and kept talking as I  shaved. </span><span id="cant-line-1303">“You are one dumb motherfuc ker. You read like a third grader . You’re a </span><span id="cant-line-1304">fucking joke! You’ve never tried hard at anything in your life besides </span><span id="cant-line-1305">basketball, and you have goals? That’ s fucking  hilarious.” </span><span id="cant-line-1306">After shaving peach fuzz from my cheeks and chin, I lathered up my scalp. I </span><span id="cant-line-1307">was desperate for a change. I wanted to become someone  new. </span><span id="cant-line-1308">“You don’t see people in the military sagging their pants. You need to stop </span><span id="cant-line-1309">talking like a wanna -be-gangster . None of this shit is gonna cut it! No more </span><span id="cant-line-1310">taking the easy way out! It’ s time to grow the fuck  up!” </span><span id="cant-line-1311">Steam billowed all around me. It rippled off my skin and poured from my </span><span id="cant-line-1312">soul. What started as a spontaneous venting session had become a solo </span><span id="cant-line-1313">intervention.“It’s on you,” I said. “Yeah, I know shit is fucked up. I know what you’ve </span><span id="cant-line-1314">been through. I was there, bitch! Merry fucking Christmas. Nobody is </span><span id="cant-line-1315">coming to save your ass! Not your mommy , not Wilmoth. Nobo dy! It’s up to </span><span id="cant-line-1316">you!” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1317">By the time I was done talking, I was shaved clean. Water pearled on my </span><span id="cant-line-1318">scalp, streamed from my forehead, and dripped down the bridge of my nose. </span><span id="cant-line-1319">I looked different, and for the first time, I’d held myself accoun table. A new </span><span id="cant-line-1320">ritual was born, one that stayed with me for years. It would help me get my </span><span id="cant-line-1321">grades up, whip my sorry ass into shape, and see me through graduation and </span><span id="cant-line-1322">into the Air  Force. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1323">The ritual was simple. I’d shave  my face and scalp every night, get loud, and </span><span id="cant-line-1324">get real. I set goals, wrote them on Post-It notes, and tagged them to what  I </span><span id="cant-line-1325">now call the Accountability Mirror , because each day I’d hold myself </span><span id="cant-line-1326">accountable to the goals I’d set. At first my goals involved shaping up my </span><span id="cant-line-1327">appearance and accomplishing all my chores without having to be  asked. </span><span id="cant-line-1328">Make your bed like you’r e in the military every  day! </span><span id="cant-line-1329">Pull up your  pants! </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1330">Shave your head every  morning! </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1331">Cut the  grass! </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1332">Wash all  dishes! </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1333">The Accountability Mirror kept me on point from then on, and though I was </span><span id="cant-line-1334">still young when this strategy came through me, since then I’ve found it </span><span id="cant-line-1335">useful for people  at any stage in life. You could be on the cusp of retirement, </span><span id="cant-line-1336">looking to reinvent yourself. Maybe you’re going through a bad break -up or </span><span id="cant-line-1337">have gained weight. Perhaps you’re permanently disabled, overcoming some </span><span id="cant-line-1338">other injury, or are just coming to grips with how much of your life you’ve </span><span id="cant-line-1339">wasted, living without purpose. In each case, that negativity you’re feeling is </span><span id="cant-line-1340">your internal desire for change, but change doesn’ t come easy, and the </span><span id="cant-line-1341">reason this ritual worked so well for me was because of my  tone.I wasn’ t fluffy. I was raw because that was the only way to get myself right. </span><span id="cant-line-1342">That summer between my junio r and senior year in high school I was afraid. </span><span id="cant-line-1343">I was insecure. I wasn’ t a smart  kid. I’d blown off all accountability for my </span><span id="cant-line-1344">entire teenage existence, and actually thought I was getting over on all the </span><span id="cant-line-1345">adults in my life, getting over on the system. I’d duped myself into a </span><span id="cant-line-1346">negative feedback loop of cheating and scamming that on the surface looked </span><span id="cant-line-1347">like advancement until I hit a brick fucking wall called reality . That night </span><span id="cant-line-1348">when I came home and read the letter from my school, there was no denying </span><span id="cant-line-1349">the truth, and I delivered it  hard. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1350">I didn’ t dance around and say, “Geez, David, you are not taking your </span><span id="cant-line-1351">education very seriously .” No, I had to own it in the raw because the only </span><span id="cant-line-1352">way we can change is to be real with ourselves. If you don’t know shit and </span><span id="cant-line-1353">have never taken school serious ly, then say, “I’m dumb!” Tell yourself that </span><span id="cant-line-1354">you need to get your ass to work because you’re falling behind in  life! </span><span id="cant-line-1355">If you look in the mirror and you see a fat person, don’t tell yourself that you </span><span id="cant-line-1356">need to lose a couple of pounds. Tell the truth. You’re fucking fat! It’s okay . </span><span id="cant-line-1357">Just say you’re fat if you’re fat. The dirty mirror that you see every day is </span><span id="cant-line-1358">going to tell you the truth every time, so why are you still lying to yourself? </span><span id="cant-line-1359">So you can feel better for a few minutes and stay the fucking same? If you’re </span><span id="cant-line-1360">fat you need to change the fact that you’re fat because it’s very fucking </span><span id="cant-line-1361">unhealthy . I know because I’ve been  there. </span><span id="cant-line-1362">If you have worked for thirty years doing the same shit you’ve hated day in </span><span id="cant-line-1363">and day out because you were afraid to quit and take a risk, you’ve been </span><span id="cant-line-1364">living like a pussy . Period, point blank. Tell yourself the truth! That you’ve </span><span id="cant-line-1365">wasted enough time, and that you have other dreams that will take courage </span><span id="cant-line-1366">to realize, so you don’ t die a fucking  pussy . </span><span id="cant-line-1367">Call yourself  out! </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1368">Nobody likes to hear the hard truth. Individually and as a cultu re, we avoid </span><span id="cant-line-1369">what we need to hear most. This world is fucked up, there are major </span><span id="cant-line-1370">problems in our society . We are still dividing ourselves up along racial and </span><span id="cant-line-1371">cultural lines, and people don’t have the balls to hear it! The truth is racism </span><span id="cant-line-1372">and bigotry still fucking exist and some people are so thin-skinned  they </span><span id="cant-line-1373">refuse to admit that. To this day, many in Brazil claim that there is no racismin their small town. That’ s why I have to give Kirk Freeman props. When I </span><span id="cant-line-1374">called him in the spring of 2018, he remembered what I went through very </span><span id="cant-line-1375">clearly . He’ s one of the few who isn’ t afraid of the  truth. </span><span id="cant-line-1376">But if you are the only, and you aren’ t stuck in some real-world  genocidal </span><span id="cant-line-1377">twilight zone, you’d better get real too. Your life is not fucked up because of </span><span id="cant-line-1378">overt racists or hidden syste mic racism. You aren’ t missing out on </span><span id="cant-line-1379">opportunities, making shit mone y, and getting evicted because of America or </span><span id="cant-line-1380">Donald fucking Trump or because your ancestors were slaves or because </span><span id="cant-line-1381">some people hate immigrants or Jews or harass women or believe gay people </span><span id="cant-line-1382">are going to hell. If any of that shit is stopping you from excelling in life, </span><span id="cant-line-1383">I’ve got some news. You ar e stopping  you! </span><span id="cant-line-1384">You are giving up instead of getting hard! Tell the truth about the real </span><span id="cant-line-1385">reasons for your limitations and you will turn that negativity , which is real, </span><span id="cant-line-1386">into jet fuel. Those odds stacked against you will become a damn  runway! </span><span id="cant-line-1387">There is no more time to waste.  Hours and days evaporate like creeks in the </span><span id="cant-line-1388">desert. That’ s why it’s okay to be cruel to yourself as long as you realize </span><span id="cant-line-1389">you’re doing it to become better . We all need thicker skin to improve in life. </span><span id="cant-line-1390">Being soft when you look in the mirror isn’t going to inspire the wholesale </span><span id="cant-line-1391">changes we need to shift our present and open up our  future. </span><span id="cant-line-1392">The morning after that first session with the Accountability Mirror , I trashed </span><span id="cant-line-1393">the shag steering wheel and the fuzzy dice. I tucked my shirt in and wore my </span><span id="cant-line-1394">pants with a belt, and, once school started up again, I stopped eating at my </span><span id="cant-line-1395">lunch table. For the first time, being liked and acting cool were a waste of </span><span id="cant-line-1396">my time, and instead of eating with all the popular kids, I found my own </span><span id="cant-line-1397">table and ate  alone. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1398">Mind you, the rest of my progress could not be described as a blink -and- </span><span id="cant-line-1399">you’ll-miss-it metamo rphosis. Lady Luck did not suddenly show up, run me </span><span id="cant-line-1400">a hot soapy bath, and kiss me like she loved me. In fact, the only reason I </span><span id="cant-line-1401">didn’ t become just another statistic is because, at the last possible moment, I </span><span id="cant-line-1402">got to  work. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1403">During my senior year in high school, all I cared about was working out, </span><span id="cant-line-1404">playing basketb all, and studying, and it was the Accountability Mirror thatkept me motivated to keep pushing toward something better . I woke up </span><span id="cant-line-1405">before dawn and started going to the YMCA most mornings at 5 a.m. before </span><span id="cant-line-1406">school to hit the weights. I ran all the damn time, usually around the local </span><span id="cant-line-1407">golf course after dark. One night I ran thirteen miles—the most  I’d ever run </span><span id="cant-line-1408">in my entire life. On that run I came to a familiar intersection . It was the </span><span id="cant-line-1409">same street where that redneck had pulled a gun on me. I avoided it and ran </span><span id="cant-line-1410">on, covering a half mile in the opposite direction before something told me </span><span id="cant-line-1411">to turn back. When I arrived at that intersection a second time, I stopped and </span><span id="cant-line-1412">contemplated it. I was scared shitless of that street, my heart was leaping </span><span id="cant-line-1413">from my chest, which is exactly why I suddenly started charging down its </span><span id="cant-line-1414">fucking  throat. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1415">Within seconds, two snarling dogs got loose and chased me as the woods </span><span id="cant-line-1416">leaned in on both sides. It was all I could do to stay a step ahead of the </span><span id="cant-line-1417">beasts. I kept expecting that truck to reappear and run me the fuck down, like </span><span id="cant-line-1418">some scene from  Mississippi circa 1965, but I kept running, faster and faster , </span><span id="cant-line-1419">until I was breathless. Eventuall y the hounds of Hell gave up and loped off, </span><span id="cant-line-1420">and it was just me, the rhythm and steam of my breath, and that deep country </span><span id="cant-line-1421">quiet. It was cleansing. By the time I turned back, my fear was gone. I </span><span id="cant-line-1422">owned that fucking  street. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1423">From then on, I brainwashed myself into craving discomfort. If it was </span><span id="cant-line-1424">raining, I would go run. Whenever it started snowing, my mind would say, </span><span id="cant-line-1425">Get your fucking running shoes on. Sometimes I wussed out and had to deal </span><span id="cant-line-1426">with it at the Accountability Mirror. But facing that mirror , facing myself, </span><span id="cant-line-1427">motivated me to fight through uncomfortable experiences, and, as a result, I </span><span id="cant-line-1428">became tougher . And being tough and resilient helped me meet my  goals. </span><span id="cant-line-1429">Nothing was as hard for me as learning. The kitchen table became my all- </span><span id="cant-line-1430">day, all-night  study hall. After I’d failed the ASVAB a second time, my </span><span id="cant-line-1431">mother realized that I was serious about the Air Force, so she found me a </span><span id="cant-line-1432">tutor who helped me figure out a system I could use to learn. That system </span><span id="cant-line-1433">was memorization. I couldn’ t learn just by scratching a few notes and </span><span id="cant-line-1434">memorizing those. I had to read a text book and write each page down in my </span><span id="cant-line-1435">notebook. Then do it again a second and third time. That’ s how knowledge </span><span id="cant-line-1436">stuck to the mirror of my mind. Not through learning, but through </span><span id="cant-line-1437">transcription, memorization, and  recall.I did that for English. I did that for history . I wrote out and memorized </span><span id="cant-line-1438">formulas for algebra. If my tutor took an hour to teach me a lesson, I had to </span><span id="cant-line-1439">go back over my notes from that session for six hours to lock it in. My </span><span id="cant-line-1440">personal study hall schedule and goals became Post-It notes on my </span><span id="cant-line-1441">Accountability Mirror , and guess what happened? I developed an obsession </span><span id="cant-line-1442">for learning. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1443">Over six months I went from having a fourth grade reading level to that of a </span><span id="cant-line-1444">senior in high school. My vocab ulary mushroomed. I wrote out thousands of </span><span id="cant-line-1445">flash cards and went over them  for hours, days, and weeks. I did the same </span><span id="cant-line-1446">for math ematical formulas. Part of it was survival instinct. I damn sure </span><span id="cant-line-1447">wasn’ t going to get into colleg e based on academics, and though I was a </span><span id="cant-line-1448">starter on the varsity basketball team my senior year, no college scouts knew </span><span id="cant-line-1449">my name. All I knew was that I had to get the fuck out of Brazil, Indiana; </span><span id="cant-line-1450">that the military  was my best chance; and to get there I had to pass the </span><span id="cant-line-1451">ASVAB. On my third try , I met the minimum standard for the Air  Force. </span><span id="cant-line-1452">Living with purpose changed everything for me—at least in the short term. </span><span id="cant-line-1453">During my senior year in high school, studying and working out gave my </span><span id="cant-line-1454">mind so much energy that hate flaked from my soul like used-up snake skin. </span><span id="cant-line-1455">The resentment I held toward the racists in Brazil, the emotion that had </span><span id="cant-line-1456">dominated me and was burning  me up inside, dissipated because I’d finally </span><span id="cant-line-1457">considered the fucking  source. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1458">I looked at the people who were making me feel uncomfortable and realized </span><span id="cant-line-1459">how uncomfortable they were in their own skin. To make fun of or try to </span><span id="cant-line-1460">intimidate some one they didn’ t even know based on race alone was a clear </span><span id="cant-line-1461">indication that something was very wrong with them, not me. But when you </span><span id="cant-line-1462">have no confide nce it becomes easy to value other people’ s opinions, and I </span><span id="cant-line-1463">was valuing everyone’ s opinion without considering the minds that generated </span><span id="cant-line-1464">them. That soun ds silly, but it’s an easy trap to fall into, especially when you </span><span id="cant-line-1465">are insecure on top of being the only. As soon as I made that connection, </span><span id="cant-line-1466">being upset with them was not worth my time. Because if I was gonna kick </span><span id="cant-line-1467">their ass in life, and I was, I had way too much shit to do. Each insult or </span><span id="cant-line-1468">dismissive gesture became more fuel for the engine revving inside  me. </span><span id="cant-line-1469">By the time I graduated, I knew that the confidence I’d managed to develop </span><span id="cant-line-1470">didn’ t come from a perfect family or God-given  talent. It came frompersonal accountability which brought me self respect, and self respect will </span><span id="cant-line-1471">always light a way  forward. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1472">For me, it lit up a path straight out of Brazil, forever . But I didn’ t get away </span><span id="cant-line-1473">clean. When you transcend a place in time that has challenged you to the </span><span id="cant-line-1474">core, it can feel like you’ve won a war. Don’ t fall for that mirage. Your past, </span><span id="cant-line-1475">your deepest fears, have a way of going dormant before sprin ging back to </span><span id="cant-line-1476">life at double strength. You must remain vigilant. For me, the Air Force </span><span id="cant-line-1477">revealed that I was still soft inside. I was still  insecure. </span><span id="cant-line-1478">I wasn’ t yet hard of bone and  mind.CHALLENGE #2 </span><span id="cant-line-1479">It’s time to come eyeball to eyeball with yourself, and get raw and real. This </span><span id="cant-line-1480">is not a self-love tactic. You can’t fluff it. Don’ t massage your ego. This is </span><span id="cant-line-1481">about abolishing the ego and taking the first step toward becom ing the real </span><span id="cant-line-1482">you! </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1483">I tacked Post-It notes on my Accountability Mirror , and I’ll ask you to do </span><span id="cant-line-1484">the same . Digital devices won’ t work. Write all your insecurities, dreams, </span><span id="cant-line-1485">and goals on Post-Its and tag up your mirror . If you need more education, </span><span id="cant-line-1486">remind yourself that you need to start working your ass off because you </span><span id="cant-line-1487">aren’ t smart enough! Period, point blank. If you look in the mirror and see </span><span id="cant-line-1488">someone who is obviously overw eight, that means you’re fucking fat! Own </span><span id="cant-line-1489">it! It’s okay to be unkind with yourself in these moments becau se we need </span><span id="cant-line-1490">thicker skin to improve in  life. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1491">Whether it’s a career goal (quit my job, start a business), a lifestyle goal </span><span id="cant-line-1492">(lose weight, get more active), or an athletic one (run my first 5K, 10K, or </span><span id="cant-line-1493">marathon), you need to be truthful with yourself about where you are and </span><span id="cant-line-1494">the necessary steps it will take to achieve those goals, day by day. Each </span><span id="cant-line-1495">step, each necessary point of self-improvement , should be written as its own </span><span id="cant-line-1496">note. That mean s you have to do some research and break it all down. For </span><span id="cant-line-1497">example, if you are trying to lose forty pounds, your first Post-It may be to </span><span id="cant-line-1498">lose two pounds in the first week. Once that goal is achieved, remove the </span><span id="cant-line-1499">note and post the next goal of two to five pounds until your ultimate goal is </span><span id="cant-line-1500">realized. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1501">Whatever your goal, you’ll need  to hold yourself accountable for the small </span><span id="cant-line-1502">steps it will take to get there. Self-improvement  takes dedication and self- </span><span id="cant-line-1503">discipline . The dirty mirror you see every  day is going to reveal the truth. </span><span id="cant-line-1504">Stop ignoring it. Use it to your advantage.

THE IMPOSSIBLE T ASK </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1508">IT WAS  PAST  MIDNIGHT  AND  THE  STREETS  WERE  DEAD . I STEERED  MY  PICKUP  TRUCK </span><span id="cant-line-1509">into another empty parking lot and killed the engine. In the quiet all I could </span><span id="cant-line-1510">hear were the eerie halogen hum of the street lamps and the scratch of my </span><span id="cant-line-1511">pen as I checked off another franchise feed trough. The latest in a never - </span><span id="cant-line-1512">ending series of fast food and dine-in industrial kitchens that received more </span><span id="cant-line-1513">nightly visitors than you’d care to know about. That’ s why guys like me </span><span id="cant-line-1514">showed up to places like this in the wee hours. I stuffed my clipboard under </span><span id="cant-line-1515">the armrest, grabbed my gear , and began restocking rat  traps. </span><span id="cant-line-1516">They’re everyw here, those little green boxes. Look around almost any </span><span id="cant-line-1517">restaurant and you’ll find them, hidden in plain sight. My job was to bait, </span><span id="cant-line-1518">move, or replac e them. Sometimes I hit pay dirt and found a rat carcass, </span><span id="cant-line-1519">which never caught me by surprise. Y ou know death when you smell  it. </span><span id="cant-line-1520">This wasn’t the mission I signed up for when I enlisted in the Air Force with </span><span id="cant-line-1521">dreams of joining a Pararescue unit. Back then I was nineteen years old and </span><span id="cant-line-1522">weighed 175 pounds. By the time I was dischar ged four years later, I had </span><span id="cant-line-1523">ballooned to nearly 300 pounds and was on a different kind of patrol. At that </span><span id="cant-line-1524">weight, even bending down to bait the traps took effort. I was so damn fat I </span><span id="cant-line-1525">had to sew an athletic sock into the crotch of my work pants so they </span><span id="cant-line-1526">wouldn’ t split when I dropped to one knee. No bullshit. I was a sorry fucking </span><span id="cant-line-1527">sight. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1528">With the exterior handled, it was time to venture indoors, which was its own </span><span id="cant-line-1529">wilderness. I had keys to almost every restaurant in this part of Indianapolis, </span><span id="cant-line-1530">and their alarm codes too. Once inside, I pumped my hand -held silver </span><span id="cant-line-1531">canister full of poison and place d a fumigation mask over my face. I lookedlike a damn space alien in that thing, with its dual filters jutting out from my </span><span id="cant-line-1532">mouth, protecting me from toxic  fumes. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1533">Protecting  me. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1534">If there was anything I liked about that job it was the stealth nature of </span><span id="cant-line-1535">working late, moving in and out of inky shadows. I loved that mask for the </span><span id="cant-line-1536">same reason. It was vital, and not because of any damn insectic ide. I needed </span><span id="cant-line-1537">it because it made it impossible for anyone to see me, especially me. Even if </span><span id="cant-line-1538">by chance I caught my own reflection in a glass doorway or on a stainless </span><span id="cant-line-1539">steel countertop , it wasn’ t me I was seeing. It was some janky -ass, low- </span><span id="cant-line-1540">budget  storm trooper . The kind of guy who would palm yesterday’ s brownies </span><span id="cant-line-1541">on his way out the  door. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1542">It wasn’ t me. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1543">Sometimes I’d see roaches scurry for cover when I flipped the lights on to </span><span id="cant-line-1544">spray down the counters and the tiled floors. I’d see dead rodents stuck to </span><span id="cant-line-1545">sticky traps I’d laid on previous visits. I bagged and dumped them. I checked </span><span id="cant-line-1546">the lighting systems I’d installed  to catch moths and flies and cleaned those </span><span id="cant-line-1547">out too. Within a half hour I was gone, rolling on to the next restaurant. I had </span><span id="cant-line-1548">a dozen stops every night and had to hit them all before  dawn. </span><span id="cant-line-1549">Maybe this kind of gig sounds disgusting to you. When I think back I’m </span><span id="cant-line-1550">disgusted too, but not because of the job. It was honest work . Necessary . </span><span id="cant-line-1551">Hell, in Air Force boot camp I got on the wrong side of my first drill </span><span id="cant-line-1552">sergeant and she made me the latrine queen. It was my job to keep the </span><span id="cant-line-1553">latrines in our barracks shining. She told me that if she found one speck of </span><span id="cant-line-1554">dirt in that latrine at any momen t I would get recycled back to day one and </span><span id="cant-line-1555">join a new flight. I took my discipline. I was happy just to be in the Air </span><span id="cant-line-1556">Force, and I cleaned the hell out of that latrine. You could have eaten off that </span><span id="cant-line-1557">floor . Four years later, the guy who was so energized by opportunity that he </span><span id="cant-line-1558">was excited to clean latrines was gone and I didn’ t feel anything at  all. </span><span id="cant-line-1559">They say there’ s always light at the end of the tunnel, but not once your eyes </span><span id="cant-line-1560">adjust to the darkness, and that’s what happened to me. I was numb. Numb </span><span id="cant-line-1561">to my life, miserable in my marriage, and I’d accepted that reality. I was a </span><span id="cant-line-1562">would -be warrior turned cockroach sniper on the graveyard shift. Justanother zombie selling his time on earth, going through the motions. In fact, </span><span id="cant-line-1563">the only insight I had into my job at that time was that it was actually a step </span><span id="cant-line-1564">up. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1565">When I was first dischar ged from the military I got a job at St. Vincent’ s </span><span id="cant-line-1566">Hospital. I worked security from  11 p.m. to 7 a.m. for minimu m wage and </span><span id="cant-line-1567">cleared about $700 a month. Every now and then I’d see an Ecolab truck </span><span id="cant-line-1568">pull up. We were on the extermi nator ’s regular rotation, and it was my job to </span><span id="cant-line-1569">unlock the hospital kitchen for him. One night we got to talking, and he </span><span id="cant-line-1570">mentioned that Ecolab was hiring, and that the job came with a free truck </span><span id="cant-line-1571">and no boss looking over your shoulder . It was also a 35 percent pay raise. I </span><span id="cant-line-1572">didn’ t think about the health risks. I didn’ t think at all. I was taking what was </span><span id="cant-line-1573">being offered. I was on that spoon -fed path of least resistance, letting </span><span id="cant-line-1574">dominoes fall on my head, and it was killing me slowly . But there’ s a </span><span id="cant-line-1575">difference betwe en being numb and clueless. In the dark night there weren’ t </span><span id="cant-line-1576">a lot of distracti ons to get me out of my head, and I knew that I had tipped </span><span id="cant-line-1577">the first domino. I’d started the chain reaction that put me on Ecolab  duty. </span><span id="cant-line-1578">The Air Force should have been my way out. That first drill sergeant did end </span><span id="cant-line-1579">up recyc ling me into a different  unit, and in my new flight I became a star </span><span id="cant-line-1580">recruit. I was 6’2” and weighed about 175 pounds. I was fast and strong, our </span><span id="cant-line-1581">unit was the best flight in all of boot camp, and soon I was training for my </span><span id="cant-line-1582">dream job: Air Force Pararescue. We were guardian angels with fangs, </span><span id="cant-line-1583">trained to drop from the sky behind enemy lines and pull downed pilots out </span><span id="cant-line-1584">of harm’ s way. I was one of the best guys in that training. I was one of the </span><span id="cant-line-1585">best at push -ups, and the best at sit-ups, flutter kicks, and running. I was one </span><span id="cant-line-1586">point behind honor grad, but there was something they didn’ t talk about in </span><span id="cant-line-1587">the lead-up to Parar escue training: water confidence. That’ s a nice name for </span><span id="cant-line-1588">a course where they try to drown your ass for weeks, and I was </span><span id="cant-line-1589">uncomfortable as hell in the  water . </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1590">Although my mom got us off the public dole and out of subsidized housing </span><span id="cant-line-1591">within three years, she still didn’t have extra cash for swim lessons, and we </span><span id="cant-line-1592">avoided pools. It wasn’ t until I attended Boy Scout camp when I was twelve </span><span id="cant-line-1593">years old that I was finally confronted with swimming. Leaving Buffalo </span><span id="cant-line-1594">allowed me to join the Scouts, and camp was my best opportu nity to score </span><span id="cant-line-1595">all the merit badges I’d need to stay on the path to becoming an Eagle Scout. </span><span id="cant-line-1596">One morning it was time to qualify for the swimming merit badge and thatmeant a one-mile swim in a lake course, marked off with buoys. All the </span><span id="cant-line-1597">other kids jumped in and started getting after it, and if I wanted to save face I </span><span id="cant-line-1598">had to pretend I knew what I was doing, so I followed them into the lake. I </span><span id="cant-line-1599">dog paddled the best I could, but kept swallowing water so I flipped onto my </span><span id="cant-line-1600">back and ended up swimming the entire mile with a fucked -up backstroke </span><span id="cant-line-1601">I’d improvised on the fly . Merit badge  secured. </span><span id="cant-line-1602">Boy Scouts </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1603">When it came time to take the swim test to get into Pararescue , I needed to </span><span id="cant-line-1604">be able to swim  for real. This was a timed, 500-meter  freestyl e swim,  and </span><span id="cant-line-1605">even at nineteen years old I didn’ t know how to swim freestyle. So I took my </span><span id="cant-line-1606">stunted ass down to Barnes & Noble, bought Swimming for Dummies , </span><span id="cant-line-1607">studied the diagrams, and practiced in the pool every day. I hated putting my </span><span id="cant-line-1608">face in the wate r, but I’d manag e for one stroke, then two, and before long I </span><span id="cant-line-1609">could swim an entire  lap. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1610">I wasn’ t as buoyant as most swimmers. Whenever I stopped swimming, even </span><span id="cant-line-1611">for a moment, I’d start to sink, which made my heart pound with panic, andmy increased tension just made it worse. Eventually , I passed that swim test, </span><span id="cant-line-1612">but there is a difference between being competent and comfo rtable in the </span><span id="cant-line-1613">water , another big gap from comfortable to confident, and when you can’t </span><span id="cant-line-1614">float like most people, water confidence does not come easy. Sometimes it </span><span id="cant-line-1615">doesn’ t come at  all. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1616">In Parar escue training, water confidence is part of the ten-week  program, </span><span id="cant-line-1617">and it’s filled with specific evolutions designed to test how well we perform </span><span id="cant-line-1618">in the water under stress. One of the worst evolutions for me was called </span><span id="cant-line-1619">Bobbing. The class was divided into groups of five, lined up from gutter to </span><span id="cant-line-1620">gutter in the shallow end, and fully kitted up. Our backs were strapped with </span><span id="cant-line-1621">twin eighty -liter tanks made from galvanized steel, and we wore sixteen - </span><span id="cant-line-1622">pound  weight belts too. We were loaded the fuck down, which woul d have </span><span id="cant-line-1623">been fine, excep t in this evolutio n we weren’ t allowed to breath e from those </span><span id="cant-line-1624">tanks. Instead, we were told to walk backward down the slope of the pool </span><span id="cant-line-1625">from the three -foot section to the deep end, about ten feet down, and on that </span><span id="cant-line-1626">slow walk into position, my mind swirled with doubt and  negativity . </span><span id="cant-line-1627">What the fuck are you doing here? This isn’t for you! You can’t swim! You’re </span><span id="cant-line-1628">an imposter and they will find you  out! </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1629">Time slowed down and those seconds seemed like minutes. My diaphragm </span><span id="cant-line-1630">lurched, trying to force air into my lungs. Theoretically , I knew that </span><span id="cant-line-1631">relaxation was the key to all the underwater evolutions, but I was too </span><span id="cant-line-1632">terrified to let go. My jaw clenched as tight as my fists. My head  throbbed as </span><span id="cant-line-1633">I worked  to stave off panic. Finally , we were all in position and it was time </span><span id="cant-line-1634">to start bobbing. That meant pushing up from the bottom to the surface </span><span id="cant-line-1635">(without the benefit of finning), getting a gulp of air, and sinking  back down. </span><span id="cant-line-1636">It wasn’t easy, getting up fully loaded, but at least I was able to breathe, and </span><span id="cant-line-1637">that first breath was a salvation. Oxygen flooded my system and I started to </span><span id="cant-line-1638">relax until the instructor yelled “Switch!” That was our cue to take our fins </span><span id="cant-line-1639">from our feet, place them on our hands, and use one pull with our arms to </span><span id="cant-line-1640">propel ourselves to the surface. We were allowed to push off the floor of the </span><span id="cant-line-1641">pool, but we couldn’ t kick. W e did that for five  minutes. </span><span id="cant-line-1642">Shallow water and surface blackouts aren’ t uncommon during water </span><span id="cant-line-1643">confidence training. It goes along with stressing the body and limiting </span><span id="cant-line-1644">oxygen intake. With the flippers on my hands I’d barely get my face highenough out of the water to breathe, and in between I was working hard and </span><span id="cant-line-1645">burning oxygen . And when you burn too much too fast, your brain shuts </span><span id="cant-line-1646">down and you will black the fuck out. Our instructors called that, “meeting </span><span id="cant-line-1647">the wizard.” As the clock ticked, I could see stars materializing in my </span><span id="cant-line-1648">peripheral vision and felt the wizard creeping  close. </span><span id="cant-line-1649">I passed that evolution, and soon , finning with my arms or feet became easy </span><span id="cant-line-1650">for me. What stayed hard from  beginning to end was one of our simplest </span><span id="cant-line-1651">tasks: treading water without our hands. We had to keep our hands and our </span><span id="cant-line-1652">chins high above the water , using only our legs, which we’d swirl in a </span><span id="cant-line-1653">blender -like motion, for three minutes. That doesn’ t sound like much time, </span><span id="cant-line-1654">and for most of the class it was easy. For me, it was damn near impossible. </span><span id="cant-line-1655">My chin kept hitting the water , which meant the time would start again from </span><span id="cant-line-1656">triple zero. All around me, my classmates were so comfortable their legs </span><span id="cant-line-1657">were barely moving, while mine were whirring at top speed, and I still </span><span id="cant-line-1658">couldn’ t get half as high as those white boys who looked to be defying </span><span id="cant-line-1659">gravity . </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1660">Every day it was another humili ation in the pool. Not that I was embarrassed </span><span id="cant-line-1661">publicly . I passed all the evolutions, but inside I was suffering. Each night, </span><span id="cant-line-1662">I’d fixate on the next day’s task and become so terrified I couldn ’t sleep, and </span><span id="cant-line-1663">soon my fear morphed into resentment toward my classmates  who, in my </span><span id="cant-line-1664">mind, had it easy , which dredged up my  past. </span><span id="cant-line-1665">I was the only  black man in my unit, which reminded me of my childhood in </span><span id="cant-line-1666">rural Indiana, and the harder the water confidence training became, the </span><span id="cant-line-1667">higher those dark waters would rise until it seemed I was also being drowned </span><span id="cant-line-1668">from the inside out. While the rest of my class was sleeping, that potent </span><span id="cant-line-1669">cocktail of fear and rage thrum med through my veins and my nocturnal </span><span id="cant-line-1670">fixations becam e their own kind of self-fulfilling  prophecy . One where </span><span id="cant-line-1671">failure was inevitable because my unchecked fear was unleashing something </span><span id="cant-line-1672">I couldn’ t control: the quitting  mind. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1673">It all came to a head six week s into training with the “buddy breathing” </span><span id="cant-line-1674">exercise. We partnered up, each pair gripped one another by the forearm, and </span><span id="cant-line-1675">took turns breat hing through just one snorkel. Meanwhile, the instructors </span><span id="cant-line-1676">thrashed us, trying to separate us from our snorkel. All of this was supposed </span><span id="cant-line-1677">to be happening at or near the surface, but I was negatively buoyant, whichmeant I was sinking into the middle waters of the deep end, dragging my </span><span id="cant-line-1678">partner down with me. He’d take a breath and pass the snorkel down to me. </span><span id="cant-line-1679">I’d swim  to the surface, exhal e and attempt to clear the water from our </span><span id="cant-line-1680">snorkel and get a clean breat h before passing it back to him, but the </span><span id="cant-line-1681">instructors made that almost impossible. I’d usually only clear the tube </span><span id="cant-line-1682">halfway , and inhale more water than air. From the jump, I was operating </span><span id="cant-line-1683">from an oxygen deficit while fighting to stay near the  surface. </span><span id="cant-line-1684">In milit ary training, it’s the instructors’ job to identify weak links and </span><span id="cant-line-1685">challenge them to perform or quit, and they could tell I was struggling. In the </span><span id="cant-line-1686">pool that day, one of them was always in my face, yelling and thrashing me, </span><span id="cant-line-1687">while I choked, trying and failing to gulp air through a narrow tube to stave </span><span id="cant-line-1688">off the wizard. I went under and remember looking up at the rest of the class, </span><span id="cant-line-1689">splayed out like serene starfish on the surface. Calm as can be, they passed </span><span id="cant-line-1690">their snorkels back and forth with ease, while I fumed. I know now that my </span><span id="cant-line-1691">instructor was just doing his job, but back then I thought, This fucker ’s not </span><span id="cant-line-1692">giving me a fair  shot! </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1693">I passed that evolution too, but I still had eleven more evolutions and four </span><span id="cant-line-1694">more weeks of water confidence training to go. It made sense. We would be </span><span id="cant-line-1695">jumping out of airplanes over water . We needed it. I just didn’ t want to do it </span><span id="cant-line-1696">anymore, and the next morning, I was offered a way out I hadn’ t seen </span><span id="cant-line-1697">coming. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1698">Weeks earlier , we’d had our blood drawn during a med check, and the </span><span id="cant-line-1699">doctors had just discovered I carried the Sickle Cell Trait. I didn’ t have the </span><span id="cant-line-1700">disease, Sickle Cell Anemia, but I had the trait, which was believed at the </span><span id="cant-line-1701">time to increase the risk of sudden, exercise -related  death due to cardiac </span><span id="cant-line-1702">arrest. The Air Force didn’ t want me dropping dead in the middle of an </span><span id="cant-line-1703">evolution and pulled me out of training on a medical. I pretended to take the </span><span id="cant-line-1704">news hard, as if my dream was being ripped away . I made a big fucking act </span><span id="cant-line-1705">of being pissed of f, but inside I was  ecstatic. </span><span id="cant-line-1706">Later that week the doctors reversed their decision. They didn’ t specifically </span><span id="cant-line-1707">say it was safe for me to continue, but they said the trait wasn’t yet well </span><span id="cant-line-1708">understood and allowed me to decide for myself. When I reported back to </span><span id="cant-line-1709">training the Master Sergeant (MSgt) informed me that I’d missed too much </span><span id="cant-line-1710">time and that if I wanted to continue I would have to start over from day one,week one. Instead of less than four weeks, I’d have to endure  another ten </span><span id="cant-line-1711">weeks of the terror , rage, and insomnia that came with water  confidence. </span><span id="cant-line-1712">These days, that kind of thing wouldn’ t even register on my radar. You tell </span><span id="cant-line-1713">me to run longer and harder than everyone else just to get a fair shake, I’d </span><span id="cant-line-1714">say, “Roger that,” and keep moving, but back then I was still half-baked . </span><span id="cant-line-1715">Physically I was strong, but I was not even close to mastering my  mind. </span><span id="cant-line-1716">The MSgt stared  at me, awaiting my response. I couldn’ t even look him in </span><span id="cant-line-1717">the eye when I said, “You know what, Master Sergeant, the doctor doesn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-1718">know much about this Sickle Cell thing, and it’ s bothering  me.” </span><span id="cant-line-1719">He nodded, emotionless, and signed the papers pulling me out of the </span><span id="cant-line-1720">program for good. He cited Sickle Cell, and on paper I didn’ t quit, but I </span><span id="cant-line-1721">knew the truth. If I had been the guy I am today , I wouldn’ t have given two </span><span id="cant-line-1722">fucks about Sickle Cell. I still have the Sickle Cell Trait. You don’t just get </span><span id="cant-line-1723">rid of it, but back then an obstacle had appeared, and I’d  folded. </span><span id="cant-line-1724">I moved on to Fort Campbell, Kentucky , told my friends and family that I </span><span id="cant-line-1725">was forced from the program on a medical, and served out my four years in </span><span id="cant-line-1726">the Tactical Air Control Party (TAC-P), which works with some special </span><span id="cant-line-1727">operations units. I trained to liaise between ground units and air support— </span><span id="cant-line-1728">fast movers like F-15s and F-16s—behind enemy lines. It was challenging </span><span id="cant-line-1729">work with intell igent people, but sadly I was never proud of it and didn’ t see </span><span id="cant-line-1730">the oppo rtunities offered becau se I knew I was a quitter who had let fear </span><span id="cant-line-1731">dictate my  future. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1732">I buried my shame in the gym and at the kitchen table. I got into powerlifting </span><span id="cant-line-1733">and layered on the mass. I ate and worked out. Worked out and ate. In my </span><span id="cant-line-1734">last days in the Air Force I weighed 255 pounds. After my dischar ge I </span><span id="cant-line-1735">continued to bulk up with both muscle and fat until I weighed nearly 300 </span><span id="cant-line-1736">pounds. I wanted to be big because being big hid David Goggins. I was able </span><span id="cant-line-1737">to tuck this 175-pound  person into those 21-inch biceps and that flabby </span><span id="cant-line-1738">belly . I grew a burly mustache and was intimidating to everyone who saw </span><span id="cant-line-1739">me, but inside I knew I was a pussy , and that’ s a haunting  feeling.After Air Force Boot Camp at 175 lbs in 1994290 lbs at the beach in 1999 </span><span id="cant-line-1740">*** </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1741">The morning I began to take charge of my destiny started out like any other . </span><span id="cant-line-1742">When the clock struck 7 a.m., my Ecolab shift ended and I hit the Steak ’n </span><span id="cant-line-1743">Shake drive -thru to score  a large chocolate milkshake. Next stop, 7-Eleven , </span><span id="cant-line-1744">for a box of Hostess mini chocolate doughnuts. I gobbled those on my forty - </span><span id="cant-line-1745">five-minute  drive home, to a beautiful apartment on a golf course in pretty </span><span id="cant-line-1746">Carmel, Indiana, which I shared with my wife, Pam, and her daughter . </span><span id="cant-line-1747">Remember that Pizza Hut incident? I married that girl. I married a girl whose </span><span id="cant-line-1748">dad called me a nigger . What does that say about  me? </span><span id="cant-line-1749">We couldn’ t afford that life. Pam wasn’ t even working, but in those credit - </span><span id="cant-line-1750">card-debt-loading  days, nothing made much sense. I was doing 70 mph on </span><span id="cant-line-1751">the highway, mainlining sugar and listening to a local classic  rock station </span><span id="cant-line-1752">when Sound of Silence  poured from the stereo. Simon & Garfunkel’ s words </span><span id="cant-line-1753">echoed like  truth. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1754">Darkness was a friend indeed. I worked in the dark, hid my true self from </span><span id="cant-line-1755">friends and stran gers. Nobody would have believed how numb and afraid I </span><span id="cant-line-1756">was back then because I looke d like a beast that no one would dare fuck </span><span id="cant-line-1757">with, but my mind wasn’ t right, and my soul was weighed down by too </span><span id="cant-line-1758">much trauma and failure. I had every excuse in the world to be a loser , and </span><span id="cant-line-1759">used them all. My life was crum bling, and Pam dealt with that by fleeing the </span><span id="cant-line-1760">scene. Her parents still lived in Brazil, just seventy miles away . We spent </span><span id="cant-line-1761">most of our time  apart. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1762">I arrived  home from work around 8 a.m., and the phone rang as soon as I </span><span id="cant-line-1763">walked in the door . It was my mother . She knew my  routine. </span><span id="cant-line-1764">“Come on over for your staple,” she  said. </span><span id="cant-line-1765">My staple was a breakfast buffet for one, the likes of which few could put </span><span id="cant-line-1766">down in a single sitting. Think: eight Pillsbury cinnamon rolls, a half-dozen </span><span id="cant-line-1767">scrambled eggs, a half-pound  of bacon, and two bowls of Fruity Pebbles. </span><span id="cant-line-1768">Don’ t forget, I had just decimated a box of donuts and a chocolate shake. Ididn’ t even have to respond. She knew I was coming. Food was my drug of </span><span id="cant-line-1769">choice and I always sucked up every last  crumb. </span><span id="cant-line-1770">I hung up, flipped on the television, and stomped down the hall to the </span><span id="cant-line-1771">shower , where I could hear a narrator ’s voice filter through the steam. I </span><span id="cant-line-1772">caught snippets. “Navy SEALs…toughest…the world.” I wrapped a towel </span><span id="cant-line-1773">around my waist and rushed back into the living room. I was so big, the </span><span id="cant-line-1774">towel barely covered my fat ass, but I sat down on the couch and didn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-1775">move for thirty  minutes. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1776">The show followed Basic Underwater Demolition SEAL (BUD/S) Training </span><span id="cant-line-1777">Class 224 through Hell Week: the most arduous series of tasks  in the most </span><span id="cant-line-1778">physically demanding training in the military . I watched men sweat and </span><span id="cant-line-1779">suffer as they tore through muddy obstacle courses, ran on the soft sand </span><span id="cant-line-1780">holding logs overhead, and shivered in icy surf. Sweat pearled on my scalp, I </span><span id="cant-line-1781">was literally on the edge of my seat as I saw guys—some of the strongest of </span><span id="cant-line-1782">them all—ring the bell and quit. Made sense. Only one-third  of the men who </span><span id="cant-line-1783">begin BUD/S make it through Hell Week, and in all of my time in </span><span id="cant-line-1784">Pararescue training, I couldn’ t remember feeling as awful as these men </span><span id="cant-line-1785">looked. They were swollen, chafed, sleep -deprived , and dead on their feet, </span><span id="cant-line-1786">and I was jealous of  them. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1787">The longer I watched the more certain I became that there were answers </span><span id="cant-line-1788">buried in all that suffering. Answers that I needed. More than once the </span><span id="cant-line-1789">camera panned over the endless frothing ocean, and each time I felt pathetic. </span><span id="cant-line-1790">The SEALs were everything I wasn’ t. They were about pride,  dignity , and </span><span id="cant-line-1791">the type of excellence that came from bathing in the fire, getting beat the </span><span id="cant-line-1792">fuck down, and going back for more, again and again. They were the human </span><span id="cant-line-1793">equivalent of the hardest, sharpest sword you could imagine. They sought </span><span id="cant-line-1794">out the flame, took the pounding for as long as necessary , longe r even, until </span><span id="cant-line-1795">they were fearless and deadly . They weren’ t motivated. They were driven. </span><span id="cant-line-1796">The show ended with graduatio n. Twenty -two proud men stood shoulder to </span><span id="cant-line-1797">shoulder in their dress white s before the camera pushed in on their </span><span id="cant-line-1798">Commanding  Officer. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1799">“In a society where mediocrity is too often the standard and too often </span><span id="cant-line-1800">rewarded,” he said, “there is intense fascination with men who detest </span><span id="cant-line-1801">mediocrity , who refuse to define themselves in conventional terms, and whoseek to transcend traditionally recognized human capabilities. This is exactly </span><span id="cant-line-1802">the type of person BUD/S is meant to find. The man who finds a way to </span><span id="cant-line-1803">complete each and every task to the best of his ability . The man who will </span><span id="cant-line-1804">adapt and overcome any and all  obstacles.” </span><span id="cant-line-1805">In that moment it felt as though the Commanding Officer was talking </span><span id="cant-line-1806">directly to me, but after the show ended I walked back to the bathroom, </span><span id="cant-line-1807">faced the mirror , and stared myself down. I looked every bit of 300 pounds. I </span><span id="cant-line-1808">was everything all the haters back home said I would be: uneducated, with </span><span id="cant-line-1809">no real world skills, zero discipline, and a dead -end future. Mediocrity </span><span id="cant-line-1810">would have been  a major promotion. I was at the bottom of the barrel of life, </span><span id="cant-line-1811">pooling in the dregs, but, for the first time in way too long, I was  awake. </span><span id="cant-line-1812">I barely spoke to my mother during breakfast, and only ate half my staple </span><span id="cant-line-1813">because my mind was on unfinished business. I’d always want ed to join an </span><span id="cant-line-1814">elite special operations unit, and beneath all the rolls of flesh and layers of </span><span id="cant-line-1815">failure, that desire was still there. Now it was coming back to life, thanks to </span><span id="cant-line-1816">a chance viewing of a show that continued to work on me like a virus </span><span id="cant-line-1817">moving cell to cell, taking  over. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1818">It became an obsession I couldn’ t shake. Every morning after work for </span><span id="cant-line-1819">almost three weeks, I called active duty recruiters in the Navy and told them </span><span id="cant-line-1820">my story . I called offices all over the country . I said I was willing to move as </span><span id="cant-line-1821">long as they could get me to SEAL training. Everyone turne d me down. </span><span id="cant-line-1822">Most weren’t interested in candidates with prior service. One local recruiting </span><span id="cant-line-1823">office was intrigued and wanted to meet in person, but when I got there they </span><span id="cant-line-1824">laughed in my face. I was way too heavy , and in their eyes I was just another </span><span id="cant-line-1825">delusional pretender . I left that meeting feeling the same  way. </span><span id="cant-line-1826">After calling all the active duty recruiting offices I could find, I dialed the </span><span id="cant-line-1827">local unit of the Naval reserves, and spoke to Petty Officer Steven Schaljo </span><span id="cant-line-1828">for the first time. Schaljo had worked with multiple F-14 Squadrons as an </span><span id="cant-line-1829">electrician and instructor at NAS Miramar for eight years before joining the </span><span id="cant-line-1830">recruitment staff in San Diego, where the SEALs train. He worked day and </span><span id="cant-line-1831">night and rose quickly in the ranks. His move to Indianapolis came with a </span><span id="cant-line-1832">promotion and the challenge of finding Navy recruits in the middle of the </span><span id="cant-line-1833">corn. He’d only been on the job in Indy for ten days by the time I called, and </span><span id="cant-line-1834">if I’d reached anyone else you probably wouldn’ t be reading this book. Butthrough a combination of dumb luck and stubborn persistence I found one of </span><span id="cant-line-1835">the finest recruiters in the Navy , a guy whose favorite task was discovering </span><span id="cant-line-1836">diamonds in the rough—prior service guys like me who were looking to re- </span><span id="cant-line-1837">enlist  and hoping to land in special  operations. </span><span id="cant-line-1838">Our initial conversation didn’ t last long. He said he could help me and that I </span><span id="cant-line-1839">should come in to meet in person. That sounded familiar . I grabbed my keys </span><span id="cant-line-1840">and drove straight to his office, but didn’ t get my hopes too high. By the </span><span id="cant-line-1841">time I arrived a half-hour later he was already on the phone with BUD/S </span><span id="cant-line-1842">administration. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1843">Every sailor in that office—all of them white—were surprised to see me </span><span id="cant-line-1844">except Schaljo. If I was a heavyweight, Schaljo was a lightweight at 5’7”, </span><span id="cant-line-1845">but he didn’ t seem fazed by my size, at least not at first. He was outgoing </span><span id="cant-line-1846">and warm, like any salesman, though I could tell he had some pit bull in him. </span><span id="cant-line-1847">He led me down a hall to weigh me in, and while standing on the scale I </span><span id="cant-line-1848">eyed a weight chart pinned to the wall. At my height, the maximum </span><span id="cant-line-1849">allowable weight for the Navy was 191 pounds. I held my breath, sucked in </span><span id="cant-line-1850">my gut as much as I could, and puffed out my chest in a sorry attempt to </span><span id="cant-line-1851">stave off the humiliating moment where he’d let me down  easy. That </span><span id="cant-line-1852">moment never  came. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1853">“You’re a big boy,” Schaljo said, smiling and shaking his head, as he </span><span id="cant-line-1854">scratched 297 pounds on a chart in his file folder . “The Navy has a program </span><span id="cant-line-1855">that allows recruits in the reserves to become active duty. That’ s what we’ll </span><span id="cant-line-1856">use for this. It’s being phased out at the end of the year, so we need to get </span><span id="cant-line-1857">you classed up before then. Point is, you have some work to do, but you </span><span id="cant-line-1858">knew that.” I followed his eyes to the weight chart and checked it again. He </span><span id="cant-line-1859">nodded, smiled, patted me on the shoulder , and left me to face my  truth. </span><span id="cant-line-1860">I had less than three months to lose 106  pounds. </span><span id="cant-line-1861">It sounded like an impossible task, which is one reason I didn’ t quit my job. </span><span id="cant-line-1862">The other was the ASVAB. That nightmare test had come back to life like </span><span id="cant-line-1863">Frankenstein’ s fucking monster . I’d passed it once before to enlist in the Air </span><span id="cant-line-1864">Force, but to qualify for BUD/S I’d have to score much higher . For two </span><span id="cant-line-1865">weeks I studied  all day and zapped pests each night. I wasn’ t working out </span><span id="cant-line-1866">yet. Serious weight loss would have to  wait.I took the test on a Saturday afternoon. The following Monday I called </span><span id="cant-line-1867">Schaljo. “Welcome to the Navy ,” he said. He downloaded the good news </span><span id="cant-line-1868">first. I’d done exceptionally well on some sections and was now officially a </span><span id="cant-line-1869">reservist, but I’d only scored a 44 on Mechanical Comprehension. To qualify </span><span id="cant-line-1870">for BUD/S I needed a 50. I’d have to retake the entire test in five  weeks. </span><span id="cant-line-1871">These days Steven Schaljo likes to call our chance connection “fate.” He </span><span id="cant-line-1872">said he could sense my drive the first moment we spoke, and that he </span><span id="cant-line-1873">believed in me from the jump, which is why my weight wasn’ t an issue for </span><span id="cant-line-1874">him, but after that ASVAB test I was full of doubt. So maybe what happened </span><span id="cant-line-1875">later that night was also a form of fate, or a much needed dose of divine </span><span id="cant-line-1876">intervention. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1877">I’m not going to drop the name of the restaurant where it went down because </span><span id="cant-line-1878">if I did you’d never eat there again and I’d have to hire a lawyer . Just know , </span><span id="cant-line-1879">this place was a disaster . I checked the traps outside first and found a dead </span><span id="cant-line-1880">rat. Inside, there were more dead rodents—a mouse and two rats—on the </span><span id="cant-line-1881">sticky traps, and roaches in the garbage which hadn’ t been emptied. I shook </span><span id="cant-line-1882">my head, got down on my knees under the sink, and sprayed up through a </span><span id="cant-line-1883">narrow gap in the wall. I didn’t know it yet, but I’d found their nesting </span><span id="cant-line-1884">column and when the poison hit they started to  scatter . </span><span id="cant-line-1885">Within seconds there was a skittering across the back of my neck. I brushed </span><span id="cant-line-1886">it off, and craned my neck to see a storm of roaches raining down to the </span><span id="cant-line-1887">kitchen floor from an open panel in the ceiling. I’d hit the motherlode of </span><span id="cant-line-1888">cockroaches and the worst infestation I ever saw on the job for Ecolab. They </span><span id="cant-line-1889">kept coming. Roaches landed on my shoulders and my head. The floor was </span><span id="cant-line-1890">writhing with  them. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1891">I left my caniste r in the kitchen,  grabbed the sticky traps, and burst outside. I </span><span id="cant-line-1892">needed fresh air and more time to figure out how I was going to clear the </span><span id="cant-line-1893">restaurant of vermin. I considered my options on my way to the dumpster to </span><span id="cant-line-1894">trash the rodents, opened the lid, and found a live raccoon, hissing mad. He </span><span id="cant-line-1895">bared his yellow teeth and lunged at me. I slammed the dumpster  shut. </span><span id="cant-line-1896">What the fuck? I mean, seriously , what the fucking fuck? When was enough </span><span id="cant-line-1897">truly going to be enough? Was I willing to let my sorry prese nt become a </span><span id="cant-line-1898">fucked -up future?  How much longer would I wait, how many more yearswould I burn, wondering if there was some greater purpose out there waiting </span><span id="cant-line-1899">for me? I knew right then that if I didn’ t make a stand and start walking the </span><span id="cant-line-1900">path of most resistance, I would end up in this mental hell  forever . </span><span id="cant-line-1901">I didn’t go back  inside that resta urant. I didn’ t collect my gear. I started my </span><span id="cant-line-1902">truck, stopped for a chocolate shake—my comfort tea at that time—and </span><span id="cant-line-1903">drove home. It was still dark when I pulled up. I didn’ t care. I stripped off </span><span id="cant-line-1904">my work clothes, put on some  sweats and laced up my running shoes. I </span><span id="cant-line-1905">hadn’ t run in over a year , but I hit the streets ready to go four  miles. </span><span id="cant-line-1906">I lasted 400 yards. My heart raced. I was so dizzy I had to sit down on the </span><span id="cant-line-1907">edge of the golf course to catch my breath before making the slow walk back </span><span id="cant-line-1908">to my house, where my melted shake was waiting to comfort me in yet </span><span id="cant-line-1909">another failure. I grabbed it, slurped, and slumped into my sofa. My eyes </span><span id="cant-line-1910">welled with  tears. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1911">Who the fuck did I think I was? I was born nothing, I’d proven nothing, and </span><span id="cant-line-1912">I still wasn’ t worth a damn thing. David Goggins, a Navy SEAL? Yeah, </span><span id="cant-line-1913">right. What a pipe dream. I couldn’ t even run down the block for five </span><span id="cant-line-1914">minutes. All my fears and insecu rities I’d bottled up for my entire life started </span><span id="cant-line-1915">raining down on my head. I was on the verge of giving in and giving up for </span><span id="cant-line-1916">good. That’ s when I found my old, beat to shit VHS copy of Rocky (the one </span><span id="cant-line-1917">I’d had for fifteen years), slid it into the machine, and fast forwarded to my </span><span id="cant-line-1918">favorite scene: Round  14. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1919">The original Rocky is still one of my all-time favorite films because it’s </span><span id="cant-line-1920">about a know -nothing  journe yman fighter living in poverty with no </span><span id="cant-line-1921">prospects. Even his own trainer won’ t work with him. Then, out of the blue, </span><span id="cant-line-1922">he’s given a title shot with the champion, Apollo Creed, the most feared </span><span id="cant-line-1923">fighter in history , a man that has knocked out every opponent he’s ever </span><span id="cant-line-1924">faced. All Rocky wants is to be the first to go the distance with Creed. That </span><span id="cant-line-1925">alone will make him someone he could be proud of for the first time in his </span><span id="cant-line-1926">life. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1927">The fight is closer than anyone anticipated, bloody and intense , and by the </span><span id="cant-line-1928">middle rounds Rocky is taking on more and more punishment. He’s losing </span><span id="cant-line-1929">the fight , and in Round 14 he gets knocked down early , but pops right back </span><span id="cant-line-1930">up in the center of the ring. Apollo moves in, stalking him like a lion. Hethrows sharp left jabs, hits a slow -footed  Rocky with a staggering </span><span id="cant-line-1931">combination, lands a punishing right hook, and another . He backs Rocky into </span><span id="cant-line-1932">a corner. Rocky’ s legs are jelly. He can’t even muster the strength to raise his </span><span id="cant-line-1933">arms in defense . Apollo slams another right hook into the side of Rocky’ s </span><span id="cant-line-1934">head, then a left hook, and a vicious right -handed  uppercut that puts Rocky </span><span id="cant-line-1935">down. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1936">Apollo retreats to the opposite corner with his arms held high, but even face </span><span id="cant-line-1937">down in that ring, Rocky doesn’ t give up. As the referee begins his ten- </span><span id="cant-line-1938">count , Rocky squirms toward the ropes. Mickey , his own trainer , urges him </span><span id="cant-line-1939">to stay down, but Rocky isn’t hearing it. He pulls himself up to one knee, </span><span id="cant-line-1940">then all fours. The referee hits six as Rocky grabs the ropes and rises up. The </span><span id="cant-line-1941">crowd roars, and Apollo turns to see him still standing. Rocky waves Apollo </span><span id="cant-line-1942">over. The champ’ s shoulders slump in  disbelief. </span><span id="cant-line-1943">The fight isn’ t over  yet. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1944">I turned of f the television and thought about my own life. It was a life devoid </span><span id="cant-line-1945">of any drive and passion, but I knew if I continued to surrende r to my fear </span><span id="cant-line-1946">and my feelings of inadequacy , I would be allowing them to dictate my </span><span id="cant-line-1947">future forever . My only other choice was to try to find the power in the </span><span id="cant-line-1948">emotions that had laid me low, harness and use them to empower me to rise </span><span id="cant-line-1949">up, which is exactly what I  did. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1950">I dumped that shake in the trash, laced up my shoes, and hit the streets again. </span><span id="cant-line-1951">On my first run, I felt severe pain in my legs and my lungs at a quarter mile. </span><span id="cant-line-1952">My heart raced and I stopped. This time I felt the same pain, my heart raced </span><span id="cant-line-1953">like a car running hot, but I ran through it and the pain faded. By the time I </span><span id="cant-line-1954">bent over to catch my breath, I’d run a full  mile. </span><span id="cant-line-1955">That’ s when I first realized that not all physical and mental limitations are </span><span id="cant-line-1956">real, and that I had a habit of giving up way too soon. I also knew that it </span><span id="cant-line-1957">would take every ounce of courage and toughness I could muster to pull off </span><span id="cant-line-1958">the impo ssible. I was staring at hours, days, and weeks of non-stop suffering. </span><span id="cant-line-1959">I would have to push myself to the very edge of my mortality . I had to accept </span><span id="cant-line-1960">the very real possibility that I might die because this time I wouldn’ t quit, no </span><span id="cant-line-1961">matter how fast my heart raced and no matter how much pain I was in.Trouble was there was no battle  plan to follow , no blueprint. I had to create </span><span id="cant-line-1962">one from  scratch. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1963">The typical day went something like this. I’d wake up at 4:30 a.m., munch a </span><span id="cant-line-1964">banana, and hit the ASVAB books. Around 5 a.m., I’d take that book to my </span><span id="cant-line-1965">stationary bike where I’d sweat and study for two hours. Remember , my </span><span id="cant-line-1966">body was a mess. I couldn’ t run multiple miles yet, so I had to burn as many </span><span id="cant-line-1967">calories as I could on the bike. After that I’d drive over to Carmel High </span><span id="cant-line-1968">School and jump into the pool for a two-hour swim. From there I hit the gym </span><span id="cant-line-1969">for a circuit workout that included the bench press, the incline press, and lots </span><span id="cant-line-1970">of leg exercises. Bulk was the enemy . I needed reps, and I did five or six sets </span><span id="cant-line-1971">of 100–200 reps each. Then it was back to the stationary bike for two more </span><span id="cant-line-1972">hours. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1973">I was constantly hungry . Dinner was my one true meal each day, but there </span><span id="cant-line-1974">wasn’ t much to it. I ate a grilled  or sautéed chicken breast and some sautéed </span><span id="cant-line-1975">vegetables along with a thimble of rice. After dinner I’d do another two </span><span id="cant-line-1976">hours on the bike, hit the sack, wake up and do it all over again, knowing the </span><span id="cant-line-1977">odds were stack ed sky high against me. What I was trying to achieve is like </span><span id="cant-line-1978">a D-student  applying to Harvard, or walking into a casino and putting every </span><span id="cant-line-1979">single dollar you own on a number in roulette and acting as if winning is a </span><span id="cant-line-1980">foregone conclusion. I was betting everything I had on myself with no </span><span id="cant-line-1981">guarantees. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1982">I weighed myself twice daily , and within two weeks I’d dropped  twenty -five </span><span id="cant-line-1983">pounds. My progress only improved as I kept grinding, and the weight </span><span id="cant-line-1984">started peeling off. Ten days later I was at 250, light enough to begin doing </span><span id="cant-line-1985">push -ups, pull-ups, and to start running my ass off. I’d still wake up, hit the </span><span id="cant-line-1986">stationary bike, the pool, and the gym, but I also incorporated two-, three -, </span><span id="cant-line-1987">and four-mile runs. I ditched my running shoes and ordered a pair of Bates </span><span id="cant-line-1988">Lites, the same boots SEAL candidates wear in BUD/S, and started running </span><span id="cant-line-1989">in those. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1990">With so much effort, you’d think my nights would have been restful, but </span><span id="cant-line-1991">they were filled with anxiety . My stomach growled and my mind swirled. I’d </span><span id="cant-line-1992">dream of complex ASVAB questions and dread the next day’s workouts. I </span><span id="cant-line-1993">was putting out so much, on almost no fuel, that depression became a natural </span><span id="cant-line-1994">side effect. My splintering marriage was veering toward divorce. Pam madeit very clear that she and my stepdaughter would not be moving to San </span><span id="cant-line-1995">Diego with me, if by some miracle I could pull this off. They stayed in </span><span id="cant-line-1996">Brazil most of the time, and when I was all alone in Carm el, I was in </span><span id="cant-line-1997">turmoil. I felt both worthless and helpless as my endless stream of self- </span><span id="cant-line-1998">defeating  thoughts picked up  steam. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-1999">When depression smothers you, it blots out all light and leaves you with </span><span id="cant-line-2000">nothing to cling onto for hope. All you see is negativity . For me, the only </span><span id="cant-line-2001">way to make it through that was to feed off my depression. I had to flip it </span><span id="cant-line-2002">and convince myself that all that self-doubt  and anxiety was confirmation </span><span id="cant-line-2003">that I was no longer living an aimless life. My task may turn out to be </span><span id="cant-line-2004">impossible but at least I was back on a motherfucking  mission. </span><span id="cant-line-2005">Some nights, when I was feeling low, I’d call Schaljo. He was always in the </span><span id="cant-line-2006">office early in the morning and late at night. I didn’ t confide in him about </span><span id="cant-line-2007">my depression because I didn’ t want him to doubt me. I used those calls to </span><span id="cant-line-2008">pump myself up. I told him how many pounds I dropped and how much </span><span id="cant-line-2009">work I was putting in, and he reminded me to keep study ing for that </span><span id="cant-line-2010">ASVAB. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2011">Roger  that. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2012">I had the Rocky soundtrack on cassette and I’d listen to Going the Distance </span><span id="cant-line-2013">for inspi ration. On long bike rides and runs, with those horns blasting in my </span><span id="cant-line-2014">brain, I’d imagine myself going  through BUD/S, diving into cold water , and </span><span id="cant-line-2015">crushing Hell Week. I was wishing, I was hoping, but by the time I was </span><span id="cant-line-2016">down to 250, my quest to qualify for the SEALs wasn’ t a daydream </span><span id="cant-line-2017">anymore. I had a real chance to accomplish something most people, </span><span id="cant-line-2018">including myself, thought was impossible. Still, there were bad days. One </span><span id="cant-line-2019">morning not long after I dipped below 250, I weighed in and had only lost a </span><span id="cant-line-2020">pound from the day before. I had so much weight to lose I could not afford </span><span id="cant-line-2021">to plateau. That’ s all I thought about while running six miles and swimming </span><span id="cant-line-2022">two. I was exhausted and sore when I arrived in the gym for my typical </span><span id="cant-line-2023">three -hour circuit. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2024">After rocking over 100 pull-ups in a series of sets, I was back on the bar for </span><span id="cant-line-2025">a max set with no ceiling. Going in, my goal was to get to twelve but my </span><span id="cant-line-2026">hands were burning fire as I stretched my chin over the bar for the tenthtime. For weeks, the temptation to pull back had been ever present, and I </span><span id="cant-line-2027">always refused.  That day, however, the pain was too much and after my </span><span id="cant-line-2028">eleventh pull-up, I gave in, dropped down, and finished my workout, one </span><span id="cant-line-2029">pull-up shy. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2030">That one rep stayed with me, along with that one pound. I tried to get them </span><span id="cant-line-2031">out of my head but they wouldn’ t leave me the fuck alone. They taunted me </span><span id="cant-line-2032">on the drive home, and at my kitchen table while I ate a sliver of grilled </span><span id="cant-line-2033">chicken and a bland, baked potato. I knew I wouldn’ t sleep that night unless </span><span id="cant-line-2034">I did something about it, so I grabbed my  keys. </span><span id="cant-line-2035">“You cut corners  and you are not gonna fucking make it,” I said, out loud, as </span><span id="cant-line-2036">I drove back to the gym. “There are no shortcuts for you, Goggins!” </span><span id="cant-line-2037">I did my entire pull-up workout over again. One missed pull-up cost me an </span><span id="cant-line-2038">extra 250, and there would be similar episodes. Whenever I cut a run or </span><span id="cant-line-2039">swim short because I was hungry or tired, I’d always go back and beat </span><span id="cant-line-2040">myself down even harder . That was the only way I could manage the demons </span><span id="cant-line-2041">in my mind. Either way there would be suffering. I had to choose between </span><span id="cant-line-2042">physical suffering in the moment, and the mental anguish of wondering if </span><span id="cant-line-2043">that one missed pull-up, that last lap in the pool, the quarter mile I skipped </span><span id="cant-line-2044">on the road or trail, would end up costing me an opportunity of a lifetime. It </span><span id="cant-line-2045">was an easy choice. When it came to the SEALs, I wasn’ t leaving anything </span><span id="cant-line-2046">up to  chance. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2047">On the eve of the ASVAB, with four weeks to go before training, making </span><span id="cant-line-2048">weight was no longer a worry . I was already down to 215 pounds and was </span><span id="cant-line-2049">faster and stronger than I’d ever been. I was running six miles a day, </span><span id="cant-line-2050">bicycling over twenty miles, and swimming more than two. All of it in the </span><span id="cant-line-2051">dead of winter . My favorite run was the six-mile Monon trail, an asphalt bike </span><span id="cant-line-2052">and walking path that laced through the trees in Indianapolis. It was the </span><span id="cant-line-2053">domain of cyclists and socce r moms with jogging strollers, weekend </span><span id="cant-line-2054">warriors and seniors. By then Schaljo had passed along the Navy SEAL </span><span id="cant-line-2055">warning order . It included all the workouts I would be expected to complete </span><span id="cant-line-2056">during first phase of BUD/S, and I was happy to double them.  I knew that </span><span id="cant-line-2057">190 men usually  class -up for a typical SEAL training and only about forty </span><span id="cant-line-2058">people make it all the way through. I didn’ t want to be just one of those </span><span id="cant-line-2059">forty . I wanted to be the  best.But I had to pass the damn ASVAB first. I’d been cramming every spare </span><span id="cant-line-2060">second. If I wasn’t working out, I was at my kitchen table, memorizing </span><span id="cant-line-2061">formulas and cycling through hundreds of vocabulary words. With my </span><span id="cant-line-2062">physical training  going well, all my anxiety stuck to the ASVAB like paper </span><span id="cant-line-2063">clips to a magnet. This would be my last chance to take the test before my </span><span id="cant-line-2064">eligibility for the SEALs expir ed. I wasn’ t very smart, and based on past </span><span id="cant-line-2065">academic perfor mance there was no good reason to believe I’d pass with a </span><span id="cant-line-2066">score high enoug h to qualify for the SEALs. If I failed, my dream would die, </span><span id="cant-line-2067">and I’d be floating without purpose once  again. </span><span id="cant-line-2068">The test was held in a small classroom on Fort Benjamin Harrison in </span><span id="cant-line-2069">Indianapolis. There were about thirty people there, all of us young. Most </span><span id="cant-line-2070">were just out of high school. We were each assigned an old-school  desktop </span><span id="cant-line-2071">computer . In the past month, the test had been digitized and I wasn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-2072">experienced with computers. I didn’ t even think I could work the damn </span><span id="cant-line-2073">machine let alone answer the questions, but the program proved idiot proof </span><span id="cant-line-2074">and I settled  in. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2075">The ASVAB has ten sections, and I was breezing through until I reached </span><span id="cant-line-2076">Mechanical Comprehension, my truth serum. Within the hour I would have a </span><span id="cant-line-2077">decent idea if I’d been lying to myself or if I had the raw stuff necessary to </span><span id="cant-line-2078">become a SEAL. Whenever a question stumped me, I marked my worksheet </span><span id="cant-line-2079">with a dash. There were about thirty questions in that section and by the time </span><span id="cant-line-2080">I completed the test, I’d guessed at least ten times. I needed some of them to </span><span id="cant-line-2081">go my way or I was  out. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2082">After completing the final section, I was prompted to send the entire bundle </span><span id="cant-line-2083">to the administr ator’s computer  at the front of the room where the score </span><span id="cant-line-2084">would be tabula ted instantly . I peeked over my monitor and saw him sitting </span><span id="cant-line-2085">there, waiting. I pointed, clicke d, and left the room. Buzzing with nervous </span><span id="cant-line-2086">energy, I paced the parking lot for a few minutes before finally ducking into </span><span id="cant-line-2087">my Honda Accord, but I didn’ t start the engine. I couldn’ t leave. </span><span id="cant-line-2088">I sat in the front  seat for fifteen minutes with a thousand -yard stare. It would </span><span id="cant-line-2089">be at least two days before Schaljo would call with my results, but the </span><span id="cant-line-2090">answer to the riddle that was my future was already solved. I knew exactly </span><span id="cant-line-2091">where it was, and I had to know  the truth. I gathered myself, walked back in, </span><span id="cant-line-2092">and approached the fortune  teller .“You gotta tell me what I got on this fucking test, man,” I said. He peered up </span><span id="cant-line-2093">at me, surprised, but he didn’ t buckle. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2094">“I’m sorry , son. This is the government. There’ s a system for how they do </span><span id="cant-line-2095">things,” he said. “I didn’ t make the rules and I can’ t bend  them.” </span><span id="cant-line-2096">“Sir, you have no idea what this test means to me, to my life. It’s </span><span id="cant-line-2097">everything!” He looked into my glassy eyes for what felt like five minutes, </span><span id="cant-line-2098">then turned toward his  machine. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2099">“I’m breaking every rule in the book right now,” he said. “Gogg ins, right?” I </span><span id="cant-line-2100">nodded and came around behind  his seat as he scrolled through files. “There </span><span id="cant-line-2101">you are. Congratulations, you scored 65. That’ s a great score.” He was </span><span id="cant-line-2102">referencing my overall, but I didn’t care about that. Everything hinged on </span><span id="cant-line-2103">my getting a 50- spot where it counted  most. </span><span id="cant-line-2104">“What did I get on mechanical comprehension?” He shrugged,  clicked and </span><span id="cant-line-2105">scrolled, and there it was. My new favorite number glowed on his screen: 50. </span><span id="cant-line-2106">“YES!” I shouted. “YES! YES!” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2107">There was still a handful of others taking the test, but this was the happiest </span><span id="cant-line-2108">moment in my life and I couldn’ t stifle it. I kept screaming “YES !” at the top </span><span id="cant-line-2109">of my lungs. The administrator damn near fell out of his chair and everyone </span><span id="cant-line-2110">in that room stared at me like I was crazy . If they only knew how crazed I’d </span><span id="cant-line-2111">been! For two months I’d dedicated my entire existence to this one moment, </span><span id="cant-line-2112">and I was damn well gonna enjoy it. I rushed to my car and screamed some </span><span id="cant-line-2113">more. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2114">“FUCK  YEAH!” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2115">On my drive home I called my mom. She was the one person, aside from </span><span id="cant-line-2116">Schaljo, who witnessed my metamorphosis. “I fucking did it,” I told her, </span><span id="cant-line-2117">tears in my eyes. “I fucking did it! I’m going to be a  SEAL.” </span><span id="cant-line-2118">When Schaljo came to work the next day, he got the news and called me up. </span><span id="cant-line-2119">He’d sent in my recruitment package and had just heard back that I was in! I </span><span id="cant-line-2120">could tell he was happy for me, and proud that what he saw in me the first </span><span id="cant-line-2121">time we met turned out to be  real.But it wasn’ t all happy days. My wife had given me an implied ultimatum, </span><span id="cant-line-2122">and now I had a decision to make. Abandon the opportunity I’d worked so </span><span id="cant-line-2123">hard for and stay married, or get divorced and go try to become a SEAL. In </span><span id="cant-line-2124">the end, my choice didn’ t have anything to do with my feelings for Pam or </span><span id="cant-line-2125">her father . He’d apologized to me, by the way. It was about who I was and </span><span id="cant-line-2126">who I wanted to be. I was a prisoner in my own my mind and this </span><span id="cant-line-2127">opportunity was my only chance to break  free. </span><span id="cant-line-2128">I celebrated my victory the way any SEAL candidate should. I put the fuck </span><span id="cant-line-2129">out. The following morning and for the next three weeks I spent time in the </span><span id="cant-line-2130">pool, strapped with a sixteen -pound  weight belt. I swam underwater  for fifty </span><span id="cant-line-2131">meters at a time and walked the length of the pool underwater , with a brick </span><span id="cant-line-2132">in each hand, all on a single breath. The water would not own my ass this </span><span id="cant-line-2133">time. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2134">When I was done, I’d swim a mile or two, then head to a pond near my </span><span id="cant-line-2135">mother ’s home. Remember , this was Indiana—the American Midwest—in </span><span id="cant-line-2136">December . The trees were naked. Icicles hung like crystals from the eaves of </span><span id="cant-line-2137">houses and snow blanketed the earth in all directions, but the pond wasn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-2138">completely froze n yet. I waded into the icy water , dressed in camo pants, a </span><span id="cant-line-2139">brown short sleeved t-shirt, and boots, laid back and looked into the gray </span><span id="cant-line-2140">sky. The hypothermic water washed over me, the pain was excruciating, and </span><span id="cant-line-2141">I fuckin g loved it. After a few minutes I got out and started running, water </span><span id="cant-line-2142">sloshing in my boots, sand in my underwear . Within seconds my t-shirt was </span><span id="cant-line-2143">frozen to my chest, my pants iced at the  cuffs. </span><span id="cant-line-2144">I hit the Monon trail. Steam poured from my nose and mouth as I grunted </span><span id="cant-line-2145">and slalomed speed -walkers  and joggers. Civilians. Their heads turned as I </span><span id="cant-line-2146">picked up speed  and began sprinting, like Rocky in downtown Philly . I ran </span><span id="cant-line-2147">as fast as I could for as long as I could, from a past that no longer defined </span><span id="cant-line-2148">me, toward a future undetermin ed. All I knew was that there would be pain </span><span id="cant-line-2149">and there would be  purpose. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2150">And that I was  ready .CHALLENGE #3 </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2151">The first step on the journey toward a calloused mind is stepp ing outside </span><span id="cant-line-2152">your comfort zone on a regular basis. Dig out your journal again and write </span><span id="cant-line-2153">down all the things you don’t like to do or that make you uncomfortable. </span><span id="cant-line-2154">Especially those things you know are good for  you. </span><span id="cant-line-2155">Now go do one of them, and do it  again. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2156">In the coming pages, I’ll be asking you to mirror what you just read to some </span><span id="cant-line-2157">degree, but there is no need for you to find your own impossible task and </span><span id="cant-line-2158">achieve it on the fast track. This is not about changing your life instantly , </span><span id="cant-line-2159">it’s about moving the needle  bit by bit and making those changes </span><span id="cant-line-2160">sustainable. That means diggi ng down to the micro level and doing </span><span id="cant-line-2161">something that sucks every day. Even if it’s as simple as making your bed, </span><span id="cant-line-2162">doing the dishes, ironing your clothes, or getting up before dawn and </span><span id="cant-line-2163">running two miles each day. Once that becomes comfortable, take it to five, </span><span id="cant-line-2164">then ten miles. If you already do all those things, find somethin g you aren’ t </span><span id="cant-line-2165">doing. We all have areas in our lives we either ignore or can improve upon. </span><span id="cant-line-2166">Find yours. We often choose to focus on our strengths rather than our </span><span id="cant-line-2167">weaknesses. Use this time to make your weaknesses your  strengths. </span><span id="cant-line-2168">Doing things—even small things—that make you uncomfortable will help </span><span id="cant-line-2169">make you strong. The more often you get uncomfortable the stronger you’ll </span><span id="cant-line-2170">become, and soon you’ll develop a more productive, can-do dialogue with </span><span id="cant-line-2171">yourself in stressful  situations. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2172">Take a photo or video of yourse lf in the discomfort zone, post it on social </span><span id="cant-line-2173">media describing what you’re doing and why, and don’t forget to include </span><span id="cant-line-2174">the hashtags #discomfortzone #pathofmostresistance #canthurtme </span><span id="cant-line-2175">#impossibletask.CHAPTER FOUR </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2176">4. TAKING SOULS </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2177">THE FIRS T  CONCUSSION  GRENADE  EXPLODED  AT  CLOSE  RANGE , AND  FROM  THERE </span><span id="cant-line-2178">everything unraveled in slow motion. One minute we were chilling in the </span><span id="cant-line-2179">common room, bullshitting, watching war movies, getting pumped up for the </span><span id="cant-line-2180">battle we knew was coming. Then that first explosion led to another , and </span><span id="cant-line-2181">suddenly Psycho  Pete was in our faces, screaming at the top of his lungs, his </span><span id="cant-line-2182">cheeks flushed candy apple red, that vein in his right temple throbbing. </span><span id="cant-line-2183">When he screamed, his eyes bugged out and his whole body  shook. </span><span id="cant-line-2184">“Break! The fuck! Out! Move! Move! Move!” </span><span id="cant-line-2185">My boat crew sprinted for the door single -file, just like we’d planned. </span><span id="cant-line-2186">Outside, Navy SEALs were firing their M60s into the darkness toward some </span><span id="cant-line-2187">invisible enemy . It was the bad dream we’d been waiting for our entire lives: </span><span id="cant-line-2188">the lucid  nightm are that would define or kill us. Every impulse we had told </span><span id="cant-line-2189">us to hit the dirt, but at that moment, movement was our only  option. </span><span id="cant-line-2190">The repetitive, deep bass thud of machine -gun fire penetrated our guts, the </span><span id="cant-line-2191">orange halo from another explosion in the near distance provided a shock of </span><span id="cant-line-2192">violent beauty , and our hearts hammered as we gathered on the Grinder </span><span id="cant-line-2193">awaiting orders.  This was war alright, but it wouldn’ t be fought on some </span><span id="cant-line-2194">foreign shore. This one, like most battles we fight in life, would be won or </span><span id="cant-line-2195">lost in our own  minds. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2196">Psycho Pete stomped the pock ed asphalt, his brow slick with sweat, the </span><span id="cant-line-2197">muzzle of his rifle steaming in the foggy night. “Welcome to Hell Week, </span><span id="cant-line-2198">gentlemen,” he said, calmly this time, in that sing-song  Cali-surfer  drawl ofhis. He looked us up and down like a predator eyeing his kill. “It will be my </span><span id="cant-line-2199">great pleasure to watch you  suffer.” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2200">Oh, and there would be suffering. Psycho set the tempo, called out the push - </span><span id="cant-line-2201">ups, sit-ups, and flutter kicks, the jumping lunges and dive bombers. In </span><span id="cant-line-2202">between, he and his fellow instructors hosed us down with freezing water , </span><span id="cant-line-2203">cackling the whole damn time. There were countless reps and set after set </span><span id="cant-line-2204">with no end in  sight. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2205">My classmates were gathered close, each of us on our own stenciled frog </span><span id="cant-line-2206">footprints, overl ooked by a statu e of our patron saint: The Frogman, a scaly </span><span id="cant-line-2207">alien creature from the deep with webbed feet and hands, sharp claws, and a </span><span id="cant-line-2208">motherfucking six-pack . To his left was the infamous brass bell. Ever since </span><span id="cant-line-2209">that morning when I came home from cockroach duty and got sucked into </span><span id="cant-line-2210">the Navy SEAL  show , it was this place that I’d sought. The Grinder: a slab </span><span id="cant-line-2211">of asphalt dripping with history and  misery . </span><span id="cant-line-2212">Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S) training is six months long </span><span id="cant-line-2213">and divided into three phases. First Phase is all about physical training, or </span><span id="cant-line-2214">PT. Second Phase is dive training, where we learn how to navigate </span><span id="cant-line-2215">underwater and deploy stealthy , closed circuit diving systems that emit no </span><span id="cant-line-2216">bubbles and recycle our carbon dioxide into breathable air. Third Phase is </span><span id="cant-line-2217">land warfare training. But when most people picture BUD/S they think of </span><span id="cant-line-2218">First Phase because those are the weeks that tenderize new recruits until the </span><span id="cant-line-2219">class is literally ground down from about 120 guys to the hard, gleaming </span><span id="cant-line-2220">spine that are the twenty -five to forty guys who are more worthy of the </span><span id="cant-line-2221">Trident. The emblem that tells the world we are not to be fucked  with. </span><span id="cant-line-2222">BUD/S instruct ors do that by working guys out beyond their perceived </span><span id="cant-line-2223">limits, by challenging their manhood, and insisting on objective physical </span><span id="cant-line-2224">standards of strength, stamina, and agility . Standards that are tested. In those </span><span id="cant-line-2225">first three weeks of training we had to, among other things, climb a vertical </span><span id="cant-line-2226">ten-meter  rope, hammer a half-mile-long obstacle course studded with </span><span id="cant-line-2227">American Ninja Warrior type challenges in under ten minutes, and run four </span><span id="cant-line-2228">miles on the sand in under thirty -two minutes. But if you ask me, all that was </span><span id="cant-line-2229">child’ s play . It couldn’ t even compare to the crucible of First  Phase.Hell Week is something entirely different. It’s medieval and it comes at you </span><span id="cant-line-2230">fast, detonating in just the third  week of training. When the throbbing ache </span><span id="cant-line-2231">in our muscles and joints was ratcheted up high and we lived day and night </span><span id="cant-line-2232">with an edgy , hyperventilating feeling of our breath getting out front of our </span><span id="cant-line-2233">physical rhythm, of our lungs inflating and deflating like canvas bags </span><span id="cant-line-2234">squeezed tight in a demon’ s fists, for 130 hours straight. That’ s a test that </span><span id="cant-line-2235">goes way beyond the physical and reveals your heart and character . More </span><span id="cant-line-2236">than anything, it reveals your mindset, which is exactly what it’s designed to </span><span id="cant-line-2237">do. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2238">All of this happened at the Naval Special Warfare Command Center on </span><span id="cant-line-2239">prissy -ass Corona do Island, a Southern California tourist trap that tucks into </span><span id="cant-line-2240">slender Point Loma and shelters the San Diego Marina from the open Pacific </span><span id="cant-line-2241">Ocean. But even Cali’ s golden sun couldn’ t pretty up the Grinder , and thank </span><span id="cant-line-2242">God for that. I liked it ugly. That slab of agony was everything I’d ever </span><span id="cant-line-2243">wanted. Not because I loved to suffer, but because I needed to know whether </span><span id="cant-line-2244">or not I had what it took to  belong. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2245">Thing is, most people don’ t. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2246">By the time Hell Week started, at least forty guys had already quit, and when </span><span id="cant-line-2247">they did they were forced to walk over to the bell, ring it three times, and </span><span id="cant-line-2248">place their helm et on the concrete. The ringing of the bell was first brought </span><span id="cant-line-2249">in during the Vietnam era because so many guys were quitting during </span><span id="cant-line-2250">evolutions and just walking off to the barracks. The bell was a way to keep </span><span id="cant-line-2251">track of guys, but since then it’s become a ritual that a man has to perform to </span><span id="cant-line-2252">own the fact that he’s quitting. To the quitter , the bell is closure. To me, </span><span id="cant-line-2253">every clang sounded like  progress. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2254">I never liked Psycho much, but I couldn’ t quibble with the specifics of his </span><span id="cant-line-2255">job. He and his fellow instructors were there to cull the herd. Plus, he wasn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-2256">going after the runts. He was in my face plenty , and guys bigger  than me too. </span><span id="cant-line-2257">Even the smaller dudes were studs. I was one man in a fleet of alpha </span><span id="cant-line-2258">specimens from back East and down South, the blue-collar  and big-money </span><span id="cant-line-2259">surf beaches of California, a few from corn country like me, and plenty from </span><span id="cant-line-2260">the Texas rangeland. Every BUD/S class has their share of hard-ass </span><span id="cant-line-2261">backcountry Texans. No state puts more SEALs in the pipeli ne. Must be </span><span id="cant-line-2262">something in the barbecue, but Psycho didn’ t play favorites. No matterwhere we were from or who we were, he lingered like a shadow we couldn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-2263">shake. Laughing, screaming, or quietly taunting us to our face, attempting to </span><span id="cant-line-2264">burrow into the brain of any man he tried to  break. </span><span id="cant-line-2265">Despite all that, the first hour of Hell Week was actually fun. During </span><span id="cant-line-2266">breakout, that mad rush of explosions, shooting, and shouting, you are not </span><span id="cant-line-2267">even thinking about the nightmare to come. You’re riding an adrenaline high </span><span id="cant-line-2268">because you know you’re fulfilling a rite of passage within a hallowed </span><span id="cant-line-2269">warrior tradition . Guys are looking around the Grinder , practically giddy , </span><span id="cant-line-2270">thinking, “Yeah, we’re in Hell Week, motherfuckers!” Ah, but reality has a </span><span id="cant-line-2271">way of kicking everyone in the teeth sooner or  later. </span><span id="cant-line-2272">“You call this putting out?” Psycho Pete asked no one in particular . “This </span><span id="cant-line-2273">may be the single sorriest class we ever put through our progra m. You men </span><span id="cant-line-2274">are straight up embarrassing  yourselves.” </span><span id="cant-line-2275">He relished this part of the job. Stepping over and between us, his boot print </span><span id="cant-line-2276">in our pooling sweat and saliva, snot, tears, and blood. He thought he was </span><span id="cant-line-2277">hard. All the instructors did, and they were because they were SEALs. That </span><span id="cant-line-2278">fact alone placed them in rare air. “You boys couldn’ t have held my jock </span><span id="cant-line-2279">when I went through Hell W eek, I’ll tell you that  much.” </span><span id="cant-line-2280">I smiled to myse lf and kept hammering as Psycho brushed by. He was built </span><span id="cant-line-2281">like a tailback, quick and strong, but was he a mortal fucking weapon during </span><span id="cant-line-2282">his Hell W eek? Sir , I doubt that very fucking much, sir! </span><span id="cant-line-2283">He caught the eye of his boss, the First Phase Officer in Char ge. There was </span><span id="cant-line-2284">no doub t about him. He didn’ t talk a whole lot and didn’ t have to. He was </span><span id="cant-line-2285">6’1”, but he cast a longer shadow . Dude was jacked too. I’m talking about </span><span id="cant-line-2286">225 pounds of muscle wrapped tight as steel, without an ounce of sympathy . </span><span id="cant-line-2287">He looked like a Silverback Gorilla (SBG), and loomed like a Godfather of </span><span id="cant-line-2288">pain, making silent calculations, taking mental  notes. </span><span id="cant-line-2289">“Sir, my dick’ s getting stiff just thinking about these gaping vaginas weeping </span><span id="cant-line-2290">and quitting like whiny little bitches this week,” Psycho said. SBG offered </span><span id="cant-line-2291">half a nod as Psycho stared through me. “Oh, and you will quit,” he said </span><span id="cant-line-2292">softly . “I’ll make sure of  that.”Psycho’ s threats  were spookier when he delivered them in a relaxed tone like </span><span id="cant-line-2293">that, but there were plenty of times when his eyes went dark, his brow </span><span id="cant-line-2294">twisted, the blood rushed to his face, and he unleashed a scream that built </span><span id="cant-line-2295">from the tips of his toes to the crown of his bald head. An hour into Hell </span><span id="cant-line-2296">Week, he knelt down, pressed his face within an inch of my own while I </span><span id="cant-line-2297">finished another set of push -ups, and let  loose. </span><span id="cant-line-2298">“Hit the surf, you miserable fucking  turds!” </span><span id="cant-line-2299">We’d been in BUD/S for nearly  three weeks by then, and we’d raced up and </span><span id="cant-line-2300">over the fifteen -foot berm that divided the beach from the cinderblock </span><span id="cant-line-2301">sprawl of offices, locker rooms, barracks, and classrooms that is the BUD/S </span><span id="cant-line-2302">compound plent y of times. Usua lly to lie back in the shallows, fully dressed, </span><span id="cant-line-2303">then roll in the sand—until we were covered in sand from head to toe— </span><span id="cant-line-2304">before charging back to the Grinder , dripping heavy with salt water and </span><span id="cant-line-2305">sand, which ramped up the degree of difficulty on the pull-up bar. That ritual </span><span id="cant-line-2306">was called getting wet and sandy , and they wanted sand in our ears, up our </span><span id="cant-line-2307">noses, and in every orifice of our body , but this time we were on the verge of </span><span id="cant-line-2308">something called surf torture, which is a special kind of  beast. </span><span id="cant-line-2309">As instructed, we charged into the surf screaming like senseis . Fully clothed, </span><span id="cant-line-2310">arms linked, we waded into the impact zone. The surf was angry that </span><span id="cant-line-2311">moonless night, nearly head high, and the waves were rolling thunder that </span><span id="cant-line-2312">barreled and foamed in sets of three and four. Cold water shrive led our balls </span><span id="cant-line-2313">and swiped the breath from our lungs as the waves thrashed  us. </span><span id="cant-line-2314">This was early May, and in the spring the ocean off Coronado  ranges from </span><span id="cant-line-2315">59–63 degrees. We bobbed up and down as one, a pearl stran d of floating </span><span id="cant-line-2316">heads scanning the horizon for any hint of swell we prayed we’d  see coming </span><span id="cant-line-2317">before it towed us under . The surfers in our crew detected doom first and </span><span id="cant-line-2318">called out the waves so we could  duck dive just in time. After ten minutes or </span><span id="cant-line-2319">so, Psycho ordered us back to land. On the verge of hypothermia, we </span><span id="cant-line-2320">scrambled from the surf zone and stood at attention, while being checked by </span><span id="cant-line-2321">the doctor for hypothermia. That cycle would continue to repeat itself. The </span><span id="cant-line-2322">sky was smeared orange and red. The temperature dropped sharply as night </span><span id="cant-line-2323">loomed  close.“Say goodbye to the sun, gents,” SBG said. He made us wave at the setting </span><span id="cant-line-2324">sun. A symbolic acknowledgement of an inconvenient truth. We were about </span><span id="cant-line-2325">to freeze our natural asses  off. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2326">After an hour, we fell back into our six-man boat crews, and stood nut to </span><span id="cant-line-2327">butt, huddling tight to get warm, but it was futile. Bones were rattling up and </span><span id="cant-line-2328">down that beach. Guys were jackhammering and sniffling, a physical state </span><span id="cant-line-2329">revealing the quaking condition s of splintering minds, which were just now </span><span id="cant-line-2330">coming to grips with the reality that this shit had only just  begun. </span><span id="cant-line-2331">Even on the hardest days of First Phase prior to Hell Week, when the sheer </span><span id="cant-line-2332">volume of rope climbs and push -ups, pull-ups, and flutter kicks crushes your </span><span id="cant-line-2333">spirit, you can find a way out. Because you know that no matter how much it </span><span id="cant-line-2334">sucks, you’ll head home that night, meet friends for dinner , see a movie, </span><span id="cant-line-2335">maybe get some pussy , and sleep in your own bed. The point is, even on </span><span id="cant-line-2336">miserable days you can fixate on an escape from hell that’ s real. </span><span id="cant-line-2337">Hell Week offers no such love. Especially on day one, when an hour in they </span><span id="cant-line-2338">had us standing,  linking arms, facing the Pacific Ocean, wading in and out of </span><span id="cant-line-2339">the surf for hours. In between we were gifted soft sand sprints to warm up. </span><span id="cant-line-2340">Usually they had us carry our rigid inflatable boat or a log overhead, but the </span><span id="cant-line-2341">warmth, if it ever arrived, was always short -lived  because every ten minutes </span><span id="cant-line-2342">they rotated us back into the  water . </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2343">The clock ticked slowly that first night as the cold seeped in, colonizing our </span><span id="cant-line-2344">marrow so thoroughly the runs stopped doing any good. There would be no </span><span id="cant-line-2345">more bombs, no more shooting, and very little yelling. Instead, an eerie quiet </span><span id="cant-line-2346">expanded and deadened our spirit. In the ocean, all any of us could hear were </span><span id="cant-line-2347">the waves going overhead, the seawater we accidentally swallowed roiling in </span><span id="cant-line-2348">our guts, and our own teeth  chattering. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2349">When you’re that cold and stressed, the mind cannot comprehend the next </span><span id="cant-line-2350">120-plus hours. Five and a half days without sleep cannot be broken up into </span><span id="cant-line-2351">small pieces. There is no way to systematically attack it, which is why every </span><span id="cant-line-2352">single person who has ever tried to become a SEAL has asked  himself one </span><span id="cant-line-2353">simple question during their first dose of surf  torture: </span><span id="cant-line-2354">“Why am I  here?”Those innocuous words bubbled up in our spinning minds each time we got </span><span id="cant-line-2355">sucked under a monster wave at midnight, when we were already borderline </span><span id="cant-line-2356">hypothermic. Because nobody has to become a SEAL. We weren’ t fucking </span><span id="cant-line-2357">drafted . Becoming a SEAL is a choice. And what that single softball </span><span id="cant-line-2358">question revealed in the heat of battle is that each second we remained in </span><span id="cant-line-2359">training was also a choice, which made the entire notion of becoming a </span><span id="cant-line-2360">SEAL seem like masochism. It’s voluntary torture. And that makes no sense </span><span id="cant-line-2361">at all to the rational mind, which is why those four words unravel so many </span><span id="cant-line-2362">men. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2363">The instructors know all of this, of course, which is why they stop yelling </span><span id="cant-line-2364">early on. Instead, as the night wore on, Psycho Pete consoled us like a </span><span id="cant-line-2365">concerned older brother . He offered us hot soup, a warm shower , blankets, </span><span id="cant-line-2366">and a ride back to the barracks. That was the bait he set for quitters to snap </span><span id="cant-line-2367">up, and he harvested helmets left and right. He was taking the souls of those </span><span id="cant-line-2368">who caved because they couldn’ t answer that simple question. I get it. When </span><span id="cant-line-2369">it’s only Sunday and you know you’re going to Friday and you’re already far </span><span id="cant-line-2370">colder than you’ve ever been, you’re tempted to believe that you can’t hack </span><span id="cant-line-2371">it and that nobody can. Married guys were thinking, I could be at home, </span><span id="cant-line-2372">cuddled up to my beautiful wife instead of shivering and suffering . Single </span><span id="cant-line-2373">guys were thinking,  I could be on the hunt for pussy right  now. </span><span id="cant-line-2374">It’s tough to ignore that kind of glittering lure, but this was my second lap </span><span id="cant-line-2375">through the early stages of BUD /S. I’d tasted the evil of Hell Week as part of </span><span id="cant-line-2376">Class 230. I didn’ t make it, but I didn’ t quit. I was pulled out on a medical </span><span id="cant-line-2377">after contracting double pneumo nia. I defied doctor ’s orders three times and </span><span id="cant-line-2378">tried to stay in the fight, but they eventually forced me to the barracks and </span><span id="cant-line-2379">rolled me back to day one, week one of Class  231. </span><span id="cant-line-2380">I wasn’t all the way healed up from that bout of pneumonia when my second </span><span id="cant-line-2381">BUD/S class kicked off. My lungs were still filled with mucus and each </span><span id="cant-line-2382">cough shook my chest and sounded like a rake was scraping the inside of my </span><span id="cant-line-2383">alveoli. Still, I liked my chances a lot better this time around because I was </span><span id="cant-line-2384">prepared, and because I was in a boat crew thick with bad  motherfuckers. </span><span id="cant-line-2385">BUD/S boat crews are sorted by height because those are the guys who will </span><span id="cant-line-2386">help you carry your boat everywhere you go once Hell Week begins. Sizealone didn’ t guarantee your teammates would be tough, however , and our </span><span id="cant-line-2387">guys were a crew of square -peg misfits. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2388">There was me, the exterminator  who had to drop 100 pounds and take the </span><span id="cant-line-2389">ASVAB test twice just to get to SEAL training, only to be rolled  back almost </span><span id="cant-line-2390">immediately . We also had the late Chris Kyle. You know him as the deadliest </span><span id="cant-line-2391">sniper in Navy history . He was so successful, the hajjis in Fallujah put an </span><span id="cant-line-2392">$80,000 bounty  on his head and he became a living legend among the </span><span id="cant-line-2393">Marines he protected as a member of Seal Team Three. He won a Silver Star </span><span id="cant-line-2394">and four Bronze Stars for valor , left the military , and wrote a book, </span><span id="cant-line-2395">American Sniper , that became a hit movie starring Bradley fucking Cooper . </span><span id="cant-line-2396">But back  then he was a simple Texas hayseed rodeo cowboy who barely said </span><span id="cant-line-2397">a damn  word. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2398">Then there was Bill Brown, aka Freak Brown. Most people just called him </span><span id="cant-line-2399">Freak, and he hated it because he’d been treated like one his whole damn </span><span id="cant-line-2400">life. In many ways he was the white version of David Goggins. He came up </span><span id="cant-line-2401">tough in the river towns of South Jersey . Older kids in the neighborhood </span><span id="cant-line-2402">bullied him because of his cleft palate or because he was slow in class, </span><span id="cant-line-2403">which is how that nickname stuck. He got into enough fights over it that he </span><span id="cant-line-2404">eventually lande d in a youth detention center for a six-month  stretch. By the </span><span id="cant-line-2405">time he was nineteen he was living on his own in the hood, trying to make </span><span id="cant-line-2406">ends meet as a gas station attendant. It wasn’ t working. He had no coat and </span><span id="cant-line-2407">no car. He commuted everywhere on a rusted out ten-speed  bike, literally </span><span id="cant-line-2408">freezing his balls off. One day after work, he stopped into a Navy </span><span id="cant-line-2409">recruitment office because he knew he needed structure and purpose, and </span><span id="cant-line-2410">some warm clothes. They told him about the SEALs, and he was intrigued, </span><span id="cant-line-2411">but he couldn’ t swim. Just like me, he taught himself, and after three </span><span id="cant-line-2412">attempts he finally passed the SEAL swim  test. </span><span id="cant-line-2413">Next thing he knew , Brown was in BUD/S, where that Freak nickname </span><span id="cant-line-2414">followed him. He rocked PT and sailed through First Phase, but he wasn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-2415">nearly as solid in the classroom. Navy SEAL dive training is as tough </span><span id="cant-line-2416">intellectually as it is physically , but he scraped by and got withi n two weeks </span><span id="cant-line-2417">of becoming a BUD/S graduate when, in one of his final land warfare </span><span id="cant-line-2418">evolutions, he failed re-assembling  his weapon in a timed evolution known </span><span id="cant-line-2419">as weapons practical . Brown hit his targets but missed the time, and he </span><span id="cant-line-2420">flunked out of BUD/S at the bitter  end.But he didn’ t give up. No sir , Freak Brown wasn’ t going anywhere. I’d heard </span><span id="cant-line-2421">stories about him before he washed up with me in Class 231. He had two </span><span id="cant-line-2422">chips on his shoulders, and I liked him immediately . He was hard as hell and </span><span id="cant-line-2423">exactly the kind of guy I signed up to go to war with. When we carried our </span><span id="cant-line-2424">boat from the Grinder to the sand for the first time, I made sure we were the </span><span id="cant-line-2425">two men at the front, where the boat is at its heaviest. “Freak Brown,” I </span><span id="cant-line-2426">shouted, “we will be the pillars  of Boat Crew Two!” He looked over, and I </span><span id="cant-line-2427">glared  back. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2428">“Don’ t fucking call me that, Goggins,” he said with a  snarl. </span><span id="cant-line-2429">“Well don’t you move out of position, son! You and me, up front, all fucking </span><span id="cant-line-2430">week!” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2431">“Roger that,” he  said. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2432">I took the lead of Boat Crew Two from the beginning, and getting all six of </span><span id="cant-line-2433">us through Hell Week was my singular focus. Everyone fell in line because </span><span id="cant-line-2434">I’d already proven myself, and not just on the Grinder . In the days before </span><span id="cant-line-2435">Hell Week began I got it into my head that we needed to steal the Hell Week </span><span id="cant-line-2436">schedule from our instructors. I told our crew as much one night when we </span><span id="cant-line-2437">were hanging in the classroom, which doubled as our lounge. My words fell </span><span id="cant-line-2438">on deaf ears. A few guys laugh ed but everyone else ignored me and went </span><span id="cant-line-2439">back to their shallow ass  conversations. </span><span id="cant-line-2440">I understood why. It made no sense. How were we supposed to get a copy of </span><span id="cant-line-2441">their shit? And even if we did, wouldn’ t the anticipation make it worse? And </span><span id="cant-line-2442">what if we got caught? W as the reward worth the  risk? </span><span id="cant-line-2443">I believed it was, because I’d tasted Hell Week. Brown and a few other guys </span><span id="cant-line-2444">had too, and we knew how easy it was to think about quitting when </span><span id="cant-line-2445">confronted with levels of pain and exhaustion you didn’ t think possible. One </span><span id="cant-line-2446">hundred and thirty hours of suffering may as well be a thousand when you </span><span id="cant-line-2447">know you can’t sleep and that there will be no relief anytime soon. And we </span><span id="cant-line-2448">knew something else too. Hell Week was a mind game. The instructors used </span><span id="cant-line-2449">our suffering to pick and peel away our layers, not to find the fittest athletes. </span><span id="cant-line-2450">To find the stron gest minds. That’ s something the quitters didn’ t understand </span><span id="cant-line-2451">until it was too  late.Everything in life is a mind game! Whenever we get swept under by life’s </span><span id="cant-line-2452">dramas, large and small, we are forgetting that no matter how bad the pain </span><span id="cant-line-2453">gets, no matter how harrowing the torture, all bad things end. That forgetting </span><span id="cant-line-2454">happens the second we give control over our emotions and actions to other </span><span id="cant-line-2455">people, which can easily happen when pain is peaking. During Hell Week, </span><span id="cant-line-2456">the men who quit felt like they were running on a treadmill turned way the </span><span id="cant-line-2457">fuck up with no dashboard within reach. But, whether they ever figured it </span><span id="cant-line-2458">out or not, that was an illusion they fell  for. </span><span id="cant-line-2459">I went into Hell Week knowing I put myself there, that I wanted  to be there, </span><span id="cant-line-2460">and that I had all the tools I needed to win this fucked -up game, which gave </span><span id="cant-line-2461">me the passion to persevere and claim ownership of the experience. It </span><span id="cant-line-2462">allowed me to play hard, bend rules, and look for an edge wherever and </span><span id="cant-line-2463">whenever I could until the horn sounded on Friday afternoon. T o me this was </span><span id="cant-line-2464">war, and the enemies were our instructors who’d blatantly told us that they </span><span id="cant-line-2465">wanted to break us down and make us quit! Having their schedule in our </span><span id="cant-line-2466">heads would help us whittle the time down by memorizing what came next, </span><span id="cant-line-2467">and more than that, it would gift us a victory going in. Which would give us </span><span id="cant-line-2468">something to latch onto during Hell Week when those motherfuckers were </span><span id="cant-line-2469">beating us  down. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2470">“Yo man, I’m not playing,” I said. “W e need that  schedule!” </span><span id="cant-line-2471">I could see Kenny Bigbee, the only other black man in Class 231, raise an </span><span id="cant-line-2472">eyebrow from across the room. He’d been in my first BUD/S class, and got </span><span id="cant-line-2473">injured just before Hell Week. Now he was back for seconds too. “Oh shit,” </span><span id="cant-line-2474">he said. “David Goggins is back on the  log.” </span><span id="cant-line-2475">Kenny smiled wide and I doubled over laughing. He’d been in the </span><span id="cant-line-2476">instructors’ office listening in when the doctors were trying to pull me out of </span><span id="cant-line-2477">my first Hell Week. It was during a log PT evolution. Our boat crews were </span><span id="cant-line-2478">carrying logs as a unit up and down the beach, soaked, salty, and sandy as </span><span id="cant-line-2479">shit. I was runni ng with a log on my shoulders, vomiting blood.  Bloody snot </span><span id="cant-line-2480">streamed from my nose and mouth, and the instructors periodically grabbed </span><span id="cant-line-2481">me and sat me down nearby because they thought I might drop fucking dead. </span><span id="cant-line-2482">But every time they turned around I was back in the mix. Back on that  log.Kenny kept hearing the same refrain over the radio that night. “We need to </span><span id="cant-line-2483">get Goggins out of there,” one voice  said. </span><span id="cant-line-2484">“Roger that, sir. Goggins is sittin g down,” another voice crackled. Then after </span><span id="cant-line-2485">a beat, Kenny would hear that radio chirp again. “Oh shit, Goggins is back </span><span id="cant-line-2486">on the log. I repeat, Goggins is back on the  log!” </span><span id="cant-line-2487">Kenny loved telling that story . At 5’10” and 170 pounds, he was smaller </span><span id="cant-line-2488">than I was and wasn’ t on our boat crew , but I knew we could trust him. In </span><span id="cant-line-2489">fact, there was nobody better for the job. During Class 231, Kenny was </span><span id="cant-line-2490">tapped to keep the instructors’ office clean and tidy, which mean t that he had </span><span id="cant-line-2491">access. That night, he tiptoed into enemy territory , liberated the schedule </span><span id="cant-line-2492">from a file, made a copy , and slipped it back into position before anyone </span><span id="cant-line-2493">ever knew it was missing. Just like that we had our first victor y before the </span><span id="cant-line-2494">biggest mind game of our lives had even  begun. </span><span id="cant-line-2495">Of cours e, knowing something is coming is only a small part of the battle. </span><span id="cant-line-2496">Because torture is torture, and in Hell Week the only way to get to past it is </span><span id="cant-line-2497">to go through it. With a look or a few words, I made sure our guys were </span><span id="cant-line-2498">putting out at all times. When we stood on the beach holdi ng our boat </span><span id="cant-line-2499">overhead, or running logs up and down that motherfucker , we went hard, and </span><span id="cant-line-2500">during surf torture I hummed the saddest and most epic song from Platoon, </span><span id="cant-line-2501">while we waded into the Pacific  Ocean. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2502">I’ve always found inspiration in film. Rocky helped motivate me to achieve </span><span id="cant-line-2503">my dream of being invited to SEAL training, but Platoon  would help me and </span><span id="cant-line-2504">my crew find an edge during  the dark nights of Hell Week, when the </span><span id="cant-line-2505">instructors were mocking our pain, telling us how sorry we were, and </span><span id="cant-line-2506">sending us into the head -high surf over and over again. Adagio in Strings </span><span id="cant-line-2507">was the score to one of my favorite scenes in Platoon and with bone -chilling </span><span id="cant-line-2508">fog wrapping all around us, I stretched my arms out like Elias when he was </span><span id="cant-line-2509">getting gunned down by the Viet Cong, and sang my ass off. We’d all </span><span id="cant-line-2510">watched that movie together during First Phase, and my antic s had a dual </span><span id="cant-line-2511">effect of pissing  off the instructo rs and firing up my crew . Finding moments </span><span id="cant-line-2512">of laughter in the pain and delirium turned the entire melodramatic </span><span id="cant-line-2513">experience upside down for us. It gave us some control of our emotions. </span><span id="cant-line-2514">Again, this was all a mind game, and I damn sure wasn’ t going to  lose.But the most important games  within the game were the races that the </span><span id="cant-line-2515">instructors set up between boat crews. Damn near everything in BUD/S was </span><span id="cant-line-2516">a competition. We’d run boats and logs up and down the beach. We had </span><span id="cant-line-2517">paddle races, and we even did the damn O-Course  carrying a log or a boat </span><span id="cant-line-2518">between obstacles. We’d carry them while balancing on narrow beams, over </span><span id="cant-line-2519">spinning logs, and across rope bridges. We’d send it over the high wall, and </span><span id="cant-line-2520">we dropped it at the foot of the thirty -foot-high cargo net while  we climbed </span><span id="cant-line-2521">up and over that damn thing. The winning team was almost alwa ys rewarded </span><span id="cant-line-2522">with rest and the losing teams got extra beat downs from Psycho Pete. They </span><span id="cant-line-2523">were ordered to perform sets of push -ups and sit-ups in the wet sand,  then do </span><span id="cant-line-2524">berm sprints, their bodies quivering with exhaustion, which felt like failure </span><span id="cant-line-2525">on top of failure. Psycho let them know it too. He laughed in their face as he </span><span id="cant-line-2526">hunted  quitters. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2527">“You are absolutely pathetic,” he said. “I hope to God you fucking quit </span><span id="cant-line-2528">because if they allow you in the field you’re gonna get us all  killed!” </span><span id="cant-line-2529">Watching him berate my classm ates gave me a dual sensation. I didn’ t mind </span><span id="cant-line-2530">him doing his job, but he was a bully , and I never liked bullies. He’d been </span><span id="cant-line-2531">coming at me hard since I got back to BUD/S, and early on I decided I </span><span id="cant-line-2532">would show him that he couldn ’t get to me. Between bouts of surf torture, </span><span id="cant-line-2533">when most guys stand nut to butt to transfer heat, body to body , I stood </span><span id="cant-line-2534">apart. Everyone else was shivering. I didn’ t even twitch, and I saw how </span><span id="cant-line-2535">much that bothered  him.During Hell W eek </span><span id="cant-line-2536">The one luxury we had during Hell Week was chow . We ate like kings. </span><span id="cant-line-2537">We’re talking omelets, roast chicken and potatoes, steak, hot soup, pasta </span><span id="cant-line-2538">with meat sauce , all kinds of fruit, brownies, soda, coffee, and a lot more. </span><span id="cant-line-2539">The catch is we had to run the mile there and back, with that 200-pound  boat </span><span id="cant-line-2540">on our heads. I always left chow hall with a peanut butter sandwich tucked </span><span id="cant-line-2541">in my wet and sandy pocket to scarf on the beach when the instructors </span><span id="cant-line-2542">weren’ t looking. One day after lunch, Psycho decided to give us a bit more </span><span id="cant-line-2543">than a mile. It became obvious at the quarter mile marker , when he picked </span><span id="cant-line-2544">up his pace, that he wasn’ t taking us directly back to the  Grinder . </span><span id="cant-line-2545">“You boys better keep the fuck up!” he yelled, as one boat crew fell back. I </span><span id="cant-line-2546">checked my  guys. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2547">“We are staying on this motherfucker! Fuck  him!” </span><span id="cant-line-2548">“Roger that,” said Freak Brown. True to his word, he’d been with me on the </span><span id="cant-line-2549">front of that boat—the two heaviest points—since Sunday night, and he was </span><span id="cant-line-2550">only getting  stronger .Psycho stretched us out on the soft sand for more than four miles. He tried </span><span id="cant-line-2551">like hell to lose us, too, but we were his shadow . He switched up the </span><span id="cant-line-2552">cadence. One minute he was sprinting, then he was crouching down, wide - </span><span id="cant-line-2553">legged , grabbing his nuts and doing elephant walks, then he loped at a </span><span id="cant-line-2554">jogger ’s pace before breaking into another wind sprint down the beach. By </span><span id="cant-line-2555">then the closest  boat was a quarter mile behind, but we were clipping his </span><span id="cant-line-2556">damn heels. We mimicked his every step and refused to let our bully gain </span><span id="cant-line-2557">any satisfaction at our expense. He may have smoked everybody else but he </span><span id="cant-line-2558">did not smoke Boat Crew  Two! </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2559">Hell Week is the devil’ s opera, and it builds like a crescendo, peaking in </span><span id="cant-line-2560">torment on Wednesday and staying right there until they call it on Friday </span><span id="cant-line-2561">afternoon. By Wednesday we were all broke dick, chafed to holy Hell. Our </span><span id="cant-line-2562">whole body was one big raspberry , oozing puss and blood. Mentally we were </span><span id="cant-line-2563">zombies. The instructors had us doing simple boat raises and we were all </span><span id="cant-line-2564">dragging. Even my crew could barely lift that boat. Meanwhile , Psycho and </span><span id="cant-line-2565">SBG and the other instructors kept close watch, looking for weaknesses as </span><span id="cant-line-2566">always. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2567">I had a real hate for the instructors. They were my enemy and I was tired of </span><span id="cant-line-2568">them trying to burrow into my brain. I glanced at Brown, and for the first </span><span id="cant-line-2569">time all week he looked shaky . The whole crew did. Shit, I felt miserable </span><span id="cant-line-2570">too. My knee was the size of a grapefruit and every step I took torched my </span><span id="cant-line-2571">nerves, which is why I was searching for something to fuel me. I locked in </span><span id="cant-line-2572">on Psycho Pete. I was sick of that motherfucker . The instru ctors looked </span><span id="cant-line-2573">composed and comfortable. We were desperate, and they had what we </span><span id="cant-line-2574">needed: energy! It was time to flip the game and own real estate in their </span><span id="cant-line-2575">heads. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2576">When they clocked out that night and drove home after a pussy -ass eight </span><span id="cant-line-2577">hour shift while we were still going hard, I wanted them thinkin g about Boat </span><span id="cant-line-2578">Crew Two. I wanted to haunt them when they slipped into bed with their </span><span id="cant-line-2579">wives. I wanted to occupy so much space in their minds that they couldn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-2580">even get it up. To me that would be as powerful as putting a knife in their </span><span id="cant-line-2581">dick. So I deployed a process that I now call “T aking  Souls.” </span><span id="cant-line-2582">I turned  to Brown. “You know why I call you Freak?” I asked . He looked </span><span id="cant-line-2583">over as we lowered the boat, then lifted it up overhead like creaky robots onreserve battery power . “Because you are one of the baddest men I’ve ever </span><span id="cant-line-2584">seen in my damn life!” He cracked a smile. “And you know what I say to </span><span id="cant-line-2585">these motherfuckers right here? ” I tipped my elbow at the nine instructors </span><span id="cant-line-2586">gathered on the beach, drinking  coffee and talking bullshit. “I say, they can </span><span id="cant-line-2587">go fuck themsel ves!” Bill nodded and narrowed his eyes on our tormentors, </span><span id="cant-line-2588">while I turned to the rest of the crew . “Now let’s throw this shit up high and </span><span id="cant-line-2589">show them who we  are!” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2590">“Fucking beautiful,” Bill said. “Let’ s do it!” </span><span id="cant-line-2591">Within seconds my whole team had life. We didn’ t just lift the boat overhead </span><span id="cant-line-2592">and set it down  hard, we threw  it up, caught it overhead, tapped the sand </span><span id="cant-line-2593">with it and threw it up high again. The results were immediate and </span><span id="cant-line-2594">undeniable. Our pain and exhau stion faded. Each rep made us stronger and </span><span id="cant-line-2595">faster , and each time we threw the boat up we all  chanted. </span><span id="cant-line-2596">“YOU CAN’T HUR T BOA T CREW  TWO!” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2597">That was our fuck you  to the instructors, and we had their full attention as we </span><span id="cant-line-2598">soared on a second wind. On the toughest day of the hardest week in the </span><span id="cant-line-2599">world’ s toughes t training, Boat Crew Two was moving at lightning speed </span><span id="cant-line-2600">and making a mockery of Hell Week. The look on the instructo rs’ faces told </span><span id="cant-line-2601">a story. Their mouths hung open like they were witnessing something </span><span id="cant-line-2602">nobody had ever seen before. Some averted their eyes, almost embarrassed. </span><span id="cant-line-2603">Only SBG looked  satisfied. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2604">*** </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2605">Since that night in Hell Week, I’ve deployed the Taking Souls concept </span><span id="cant-line-2606">countless times.  Taking Souls is a ticket to finding your own reserve power </span><span id="cant-line-2607">and riding a second wind. It’s the tool you can call upon to win any </span><span id="cant-line-2608">competition or overcome every life obstacle. You can utilize it to win a chess </span><span id="cant-line-2609">match, or conquer an adversary  in a game of office politics. It can help you </span><span id="cant-line-2610">rock a job interview or excel at school. And yes, it can be used to conquer all </span><span id="cant-line-2611">manner of physical challenges, but remember , this is a game you are playing </span><span id="cant-line-2612">within yourself. Unless you’re  engaged in physical competition, I’m not </span><span id="cant-line-2613">suggesting that you try to dominate someone or crush their spirit. In fact, </span><span id="cant-line-2614">they never even  need to know you’re playing this game. This is a tactic foryou to be your best when duty calls. It’s a mind game you’re playing on </span><span id="cant-line-2615">yourself. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2616">Taking someone’ s soul means you’ve gained a tactical advantage. Life is all </span><span id="cant-line-2617">about looking for tactical advantages, which is why we stole the Hell Week </span><span id="cant-line-2618">schedule, why we nipped Psycho ’s heels on that run, and why I made a show </span><span id="cant-line-2619">of myself in the surf, hummin g the Platoon  theme song. Each of those </span><span id="cant-line-2620">incidents was an act of defiance that empowered  us. </span><span id="cant-line-2621">But defiance isn’t always the best way to take someone’ s soul. It all depends </span><span id="cant-line-2622">upon your terrain. During BUD /S, the instructors didn’ t mind if you looked </span><span id="cant-line-2623">for advantages like that. They respected it as long as you were also kicking </span><span id="cant-line-2624">ass. You must do your own homework. Know the terrain you’re operating in, </span><span id="cant-line-2625">when and where you can push boundaries, and when you should fall in  line. </span><span id="cant-line-2626">Next, take inventory of your mind and body on the eve of battle. List out </span><span id="cant-line-2627">your insecurities and weakness,  as well as your opponent’ s. For instance, if </span><span id="cant-line-2628">you’re getting bullied, and you know where you fall short or feel insecure, </span><span id="cant-line-2629">you can stay ahead of any insult s or barbs a bully may throw your way. You </span><span id="cant-line-2630">can laugh at yourself along with them, which disempowers them . If you take </span><span id="cant-line-2631">what they do or say less personally , they no longer hold any cards. Feelings </span><span id="cant-line-2632">are just feelings. On the other hand, people who are secure with themselves </span><span id="cant-line-2633">don’t bully other people. They look out for other people, so if you’re getting </span><span id="cant-line-2634">bullied you know that you’re dealing with someone who has problem areas </span><span id="cant-line-2635">you can exploit or soothe. Sometimes the best way to defeat a bully is to </span><span id="cant-line-2636">actually help them. If you can think two or three moves ahead, you will </span><span id="cant-line-2637">commandeer their thought process, and if you do that, you’ve taken their </span><span id="cant-line-2638">damn soul without them even realizing  it. </span><span id="cant-line-2639">Our SEA L instructors were our bullies, and they didn’ t realize  the games I </span><span id="cant-line-2640">was playing during that week to keep Boat Crew Two sharp. And they didn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-2641">have to. I imagined that they were obsessed with our exploits during Hell </span><span id="cant-line-2642">Week, but I don’t know that for sure. It was a ploy I used to maintain my </span><span id="cant-line-2643">mental edge and help our crew  prevail. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2644">In the same way, if you are up against a competitor for a promot ion, and you </span><span id="cant-line-2645">know where you fall short, you can shape up your game ahead of your </span><span id="cant-line-2646">interview or evaluation. In that scenario, laughing at your weaknesses won’ tsolve the problem. You must master them. In the meantime, if you are aware </span><span id="cant-line-2647">of your competi tor’s vulnerabil ities you can spin those to your advantage, </span><span id="cant-line-2648">but all of that takes research. Again, know the terrain, know yourself, and </span><span id="cant-line-2649">you’d better know your adversary in  detail. </span><span id="cant-line-2650">Once you’re in the heat of battle, it comes down to staying power . If it’s a </span><span id="cant-line-2651">difficult physica l challenge you will probably have to defeat your own </span><span id="cant-line-2652">demons before you can take your opponent’ s soul. That means rehearsing </span><span id="cant-line-2653">answers to the simple question that is sure to rise up like a thought bubble: </span><span id="cant-line-2654">“Why am I here?” If you know that moment is coming and have your answer </span><span id="cant-line-2655">ready , you will be equipped to make the split second -decision  to ignor e your </span><span id="cant-line-2656">weakened mind and keep moving. Know why you’re in the fight to stay in </span><span id="cant-line-2657">the fight! </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2658">And never forget that all emotional and physical anguish is finite! It all ends </span><span id="cant-line-2659">eventually . Smile at pain and watch it fade for at least a second or two. If </span><span id="cant-line-2660">you can do that, you can string  those seconds together and last longer than </span><span id="cant-line-2661">your opponent thinks you can, and that may be enough to catch a second </span><span id="cant-line-2662">wind. There is no scientific consensus on second wind. Some scientists think </span><span id="cant-line-2663">it’s the result of endorphins flooding your nervous system, others think it’s a </span><span id="cant-line-2664">burst of oxygen that can help break down lactic acid, as well as the glycogen </span><span id="cant-line-2665">and triglycerides muscles need to perform. Some say its purely </span><span id="cant-line-2666">psychological. All I know is that by going hard when we felt defeated we </span><span id="cant-line-2667">were able to ride a second wind  through the worst night in Hell Week. And </span><span id="cant-line-2668">once you have that second wind behind you it’s easy to break your opponent </span><span id="cant-line-2669">down and snatc h a soul. The hard part is getting to that point, because the </span><span id="cant-line-2670">ticket to victory often comes down to bringing your very best when you feel </span><span id="cant-line-2671">your worst. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2672">*** </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2673">After rocking boat presses, the whole class was gifted an hour of sleep in a </span><span id="cant-line-2674">big green army tent they’d set up on the beach and outfitted with military </span><span id="cant-line-2675">cots. Those motherfuckers had no mattresses, but may as well have been a </span><span id="cant-line-2676">cotton topped cloud of luxury because once we were horizontal we all went </span><span id="cant-line-2677">limp.Oh, but Psycho wasn’ t done with me. He let me sleep for a solitary minute, </span><span id="cant-line-2678">then woke me up and led me back onto the beach for some one-on-one time. </span><span id="cant-line-2679">He saw an opportunity to get in my head, at last, and I was disoriented as I </span><span id="cant-line-2680">staggered toward the water all alone, but the cold woke me the fuck up. I </span><span id="cant-line-2681">decided to savor my extra hour of private surf torture. When the water was </span><span id="cant-line-2682">chest high I began humming Adagio in Strings  once more. Louder this time. </span><span id="cant-line-2683">Loud enough for that motherfucker to hear me over the crash of the surf. </span><span id="cant-line-2684">That song gave me  life! </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2685">I’d come to SEAL training to see if I was hard enough to belon g and found </span><span id="cant-line-2686">an inner beast within that I never knew existed. A beast that I would tap into </span><span id="cant-line-2687">from then on whenever life went wrong. By the time I emer ged from that </span><span id="cant-line-2688">ocean, I considered myself  unbreakable. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2689">If only. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2690">Hell Week takes its toll on everybody , and later that night, with forty -eight </span><span id="cant-line-2691">hours to go, I went to med check to get a Toradol shot in my knee to bring </span><span id="cant-line-2692">the swelling down. By the time I was back on the beach, the boat crews were </span><span id="cant-line-2693">out at sea in the midst of a paddling drill. The surf was pounding, the wind </span><span id="cant-line-2694">swirling. Psycho  looked over at SBG. “What the fuck are we gonna do with </span><span id="cant-line-2695">him?” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2696">For the first time, he was hesitant, and tired of trying to beat me down. I was </span><span id="cant-line-2697">good to go, ready for any challe nge, but Psycho was over it. He was ready to </span><span id="cant-line-2698">give my ass a spa vacation. That’ s when I knew I’d outlasted him; that I had </span><span id="cant-line-2699">his soul. SBG had other ideas. He handed me a life jacket and attached a </span><span id="cant-line-2700">chem light to the back of my  hat. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2701">“Follow me,” he said as he charged up the beach. I caught up and we ran </span><span id="cant-line-2702">north for a good mile. By then we could barely see the boats and their </span><span id="cant-line-2703">bobbing lights through the mist and over the waves. “All right, Goggins. </span><span id="cant-line-2704">Now go swim out and find your fucking  boat!” </span><span id="cant-line-2705">He’d landed a hollow point  on my deepest insecurity , pierced my </span><span id="cant-line-2706">confidence, and I was stunned silent. I gave him a look that said, “Are you </span><span id="cant-line-2707">fucking kidding  me?” I was a decent swimmer by then, and surf torture </span><span id="cant-line-2708">didn’ t scare me because we weren’ t that far from shore, but an open water ,hypothermic swim a thousand yards off shore in a storm, to a boat that had </span><span id="cant-line-2709">no fucking idea I was heading their way? That sounded like a death </span><span id="cant-line-2710">sentence, and I hadn’ t prepared for anything like it. But sometimes the </span><span id="cant-line-2711">unexpected descends like chaos, and without warning even  the bravest </span><span id="cant-line-2712">among us must be ready to take on risks and tasks that seem  beyond our </span><span id="cant-line-2713">capabilities. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2714">For me, in that moment, it came  down to how I wanted to be remembered. I </span><span id="cant-line-2715">could have refus ed the order , and I wouldn’ t have gotten in trouble because I </span><span id="cant-line-2716">had no swim buddy (in SEAL training you always have to be with a swim </span><span id="cant-line-2717">buddy), and it was obvious that he was asking me to do someth ing that was </span><span id="cant-line-2718">extremely unsafe. But I also knew that my objective coming into SEAL </span><span id="cant-line-2719">training was more than making  it through to the other side with a Trident. </span><span id="cant-line-2720">For me it was the opportunity  to go up against the best of the best and </span><span id="cant-line-2721">distance myself from the pack. So even though I couldn’ t see the boats out </span><span id="cant-line-2722">past the thrashing waves there was no time to dwell on fear. There was no </span><span id="cant-line-2723">choice to make at  all. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2724">“What are you waiting on Goggins? Get your fucking ass out there, and do </span><span id="cant-line-2725">not fuck this  up!” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2726">“Roger that!” I shouted and sprinted into the surf. Trouble was, strapped </span><span id="cant-line-2727">with a buoyanc y vest, nursing a wounded knee, wearing boots, I couldn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-2728">swim for shit and it was almost impossible to duck dive through  the waves. I </span><span id="cant-line-2729">had to flail over the white wash, and with my mind managi ng so many </span><span id="cant-line-2730">variables, the ocean seemed colder than ever. I swallowed water by the </span><span id="cant-line-2731">gallon. It was as if the sea was prying open my jaws and flooding my </span><span id="cant-line-2732">system, and with each gulp, my fear  magnified. </span><span id="cant-line-2733">I had no idea that back on land, SBG was preparing for a worst -case scenario </span><span id="cant-line-2734">rescue. I didn’ t know he’d neve r put another man in that position before. I </span><span id="cant-line-2735">didn’ t realize that he saw something special in me and like any strong leader </span><span id="cant-line-2736">wanted to see how far I could take it, as he watched my light bob on the </span><span id="cant-line-2737">surface, nervous as hell. He told me all of that during a recent conversation. </span><span id="cant-line-2738">At the time I was just trying to  survive. </span><span id="cant-line-2739">I finally  made it through the surf and swam another half-mile off-shore  only </span><span id="cant-line-2740">to realize I had six boats bearing down on my head, teeter tottering in andout of view thanks to a four-foot wind swell. They didn’ t know I was there! </span><span id="cant-line-2741">My light was faint, and in the trench I couldn’ t see a damn thing. I kept </span><span id="cant-line-2742">waiting for one of them to come barreling down from the peak of a swell and </span><span id="cant-line-2743">mow me the fuck down. All I could do was bark into the darkness like a </span><span id="cant-line-2744">hoarse sea  lion. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2745">“Boat Crew T wo! Boat Crew  Two!” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2746">It was a minor miracle that my guys heard me. They whee led our boat </span><span id="cant-line-2747">around, and Freak Brown grabb ed me with his big ass hooks and hauled me </span><span id="cant-line-2748">in like a prized catch. I lay back in the middle of the boat, my eyes closed, </span><span id="cant-line-2749">and jackhammered for the first time all week. I was so cold I couldn’ t hide </span><span id="cant-line-2750">it. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2751">“Damn, Goggins,” Brown said, “you must be insane! You okay ?” I nodded </span><span id="cant-line-2752">once and got a hold of myself. I was the leader of that crew and couldn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-2753">allow myself to show weakness . I tensed every muscle in my body , and my </span><span id="cant-line-2754">shiver slowed to a stop in real  time. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2755">“That’ s how you lead from the motherfucking front,” I said, coughing up </span><span id="cant-line-2756">saltwater like a wounded bird. I couldn’ t keep a straight face for long. </span><span id="cant-line-2757">Neither could my crew . They knew damn well that crazy -ass swim wasn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-2758">my idea. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2759">As the clock ran down on Hell Week, we were in the demo  pit, just off </span><span id="cant-line-2760">Coronado’ s famous Silver Strand. The pit was filled with cold mud and </span><span id="cant-line-2761">topped off with icy water . There was a rope bridge—two separate lines, one </span><span id="cant-line-2762">for the feet and one for the hands—stretching across it from end to end. One </span><span id="cant-line-2763">by one, each man had to navigate their way across while the instructors </span><span id="cant-line-2764">shook the shit out of it, trying to make us fall. To maintain that kind of </span><span id="cant-line-2765">balance takes tremendous core strength, and we were all cooked and at our </span><span id="cant-line-2766">wits end. Plus, my knee was still fucked. In fact, it had gotten worse and </span><span id="cant-line-2767">required a pain shot every twelve hours. But when my name was called, I </span><span id="cant-line-2768">climbed onto that rope, and when the instructors went to work, I flexed my </span><span id="cant-line-2769">core and held on with all I had  left. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2770">Nine months earlier , I had toppe d out at 297 pounds and couldn’ t even run a </span><span id="cant-line-2771">quarter mile. Back then, when I was dreaming of a different life, I rememberthinking that just getting throug h Hell Week would be the biggest honor of </span><span id="cant-line-2772">my life so far. Even if I never graduated from BUD/S, surviving Hell Week </span><span id="cant-line-2773">alone would have meant something. But I didn’ t just survive. I was about to </span><span id="cant-line-2774">finish Hell Week at the top of my class, and for the first time, I knew I was a </span><span id="cant-line-2775">bad motherfucker . </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2776">Once, I was so focused on failing, I was afraid to even try. Now I would take </span><span id="cant-line-2777">on any challenge. All my life, I was terrified of water , and especially cold </span><span id="cant-line-2778">water , but standing there in the final hour, I wished the ocean, wind, and </span><span id="cant-line-2779">mud were even colder! I was completely transformed physically , which was </span><span id="cant-line-2780">a big part of my success in BUD/S, but what saw me through Hell Week was </span><span id="cant-line-2781">my mind, and I was just starting to tap into its  power . </span><span id="cant-line-2782">That’ s what I was thinking about as the instructors did their best to throw me </span><span id="cant-line-2783">off that rope bridge like a mech anical bull. I hung tough and got as far as </span><span id="cant-line-2784">anyone else in Class 231 before nature won out and I was sent spinning into </span><span id="cant-line-2785">the freezing mud. I wiped it from my eyes and mouth and laugh ed like mad </span><span id="cant-line-2786">as Freak Brown helped me up. Not long after that, SBG stepped to the edge </span><span id="cant-line-2787">of the  pit. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2788">“Hell Week secure!” He shouted to the thirty guys still left, quivering in the </span><span id="cant-line-2789">shallows. All of us chafed and bleeding, bloated and stiff. “You guys did an </span><span id="cant-line-2790">amazing  job!” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2791">Some guys screamed with joy. Others collapsed to their knees with tears in </span><span id="cant-line-2792">their eyes and thanked God. I stared into the heavens too, pulled Freak </span><span id="cant-line-2793">Brown in for a hug, and high-fived  my team. Every other boat crew had lost </span><span id="cant-line-2794">men, but not Boat Crew T wo! W e lost no men and won every single  race! </span><span id="cant-line-2795">We continued to celebrate as we boarded a bus to the Grind er. Once we </span><span id="cant-line-2796">arrived, there was a large pizza for each guy along with a sixty -four-ounce </span><span id="cant-line-2797">bottle of Gatorade and the coveted brown t-shirt. That pizza tasted like </span><span id="cant-line-2798">motherfucking manna from heaven, but the shirts meant something more </span><span id="cant-line-2799">significant. When you first arrive at BUD/S you wear white t-shirts  every </span><span id="cant-line-2800">day. Once you survive Hell W eek, you get to swap them out for brown shirts. </span><span id="cant-line-2801">It was a symbol that we’d advanced to a higher level, and after a lifetime of </span><span id="cant-line-2802">mostly failure, I definitely felt like I was someplace  new.I tried to enjoy the moment like everyone else, but my knee hadn’ t felt right </span><span id="cant-line-2803">in two days and I decided to leave and see the medics. On my way off the </span><span id="cant-line-2804">Grinder , I looked to my right and saw nearly a hundred helm ets lined up. </span><span id="cant-line-2805">They belonged to the men who’d rung the bell, and they stretched past the </span><span id="cant-line-2806">statue, all the way to the quarter deck. I read some of the names—guys who I </span><span id="cant-line-2807">liked. I knew how they felt because I was there when my Pararescue class </span><span id="cant-line-2808">graduated witho ut me. That memory had dominated me for years, but after </span><span id="cant-line-2809">130 hours of Hell, it no longer defined  me. </span><span id="cant-line-2810">Every man was required to see the medics that evening, but our bodies were </span><span id="cant-line-2811">so swollen they had a hard time discerning injuries from general soreness. </span><span id="cant-line-2812">All I knew was my right knee was thrice fucked and I needed crutches to get </span><span id="cant-line-2813">around. Freak Brown left med check bruised and battered. Kenny came out </span><span id="cant-line-2814">clean and barely limped, but he was plenty sore. Thankfully , our next </span><span id="cant-line-2815">evolution was walk week. We had seven days to eat, drink, and heal up </span><span id="cant-line-2816">before shit got real once again. It wasn’ t much, but enough time for most of </span><span id="cant-line-2817">the insane motherfuckers that managed to remain in Class 231 to get  well. </span><span id="cant-line-2818">Me, on the other hand? My swollen knee hadn’ t gotten any better by the </span><span id="cant-line-2819">time they snatched my crutches away . But there was no time for boo-hoo- </span><span id="cant-line-2820">ing. First Phase fun wasn’ t over yet. After walk week came knot tying , which </span><span id="cant-line-2821">may not sound like much but was way worse than I expected because that </span><span id="cant-line-2822">particular drill took place at the bottom of the pool, where those same </span><span id="cant-line-2823">instructors would do their best to drown my one-legged  ass. </span><span id="cant-line-2824">It was as if the Devil had been watching the whole show , waited out </span><span id="cant-line-2825">intermission, and now his favorite part was coming right up. The night </span><span id="cant-line-2826">before BUD/S kicked back up in intensity I could hear his words ringing in </span><span id="cant-line-2827">my stressed -out brain as I tossed and turned all night  long. </span><span id="cant-line-2828">They say you like suffering, Goggins.

Do everything exactly as they ask, and </span><span id="cant-line-2837">whatever standa rd they set as an ideal outcome, you should be aiming to </span><span id="cant-line-2838">surpass  that. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2839">If your coach doesn’t give you time in the games, dominate practice. Check </span><span id="cant-line-2840">the best guy on your squad and show the fuck out. That means putting time </span><span id="cant-line-2841">in off the field. Watching film so you can study your opponent’ s tendencies, </span><span id="cant-line-2842">memorizing plays, and training in the gym.

ARMORED MIND </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2857">“YOUR  KNEE  LOOKS  PRETTY  BAD , G OGGINS .” </span><span id="cant-line-2858">No fucking shit, doc. With two days to go in walk week, I’d come by </span><span id="cant-line-2859">medical for a follow -up. The doctor rolled up my camo  pants and when he </span><span id="cant-line-2860">gave my right kneecap a gentle squeeze, pain seized my brain, but I couldn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-2861">show it. I was playing a role. I was the beat up but otherwise healthy BUD/S </span><span id="cant-line-2862">student ready for the fight, and I couldn’ t so much as grimace to pull it off. I </span><span id="cant-line-2863">already knew the knee was fucked, and that the odds of getting through </span><span id="cant-line-2864">another five months of training on one leg were low, but accep ting another </span><span id="cant-line-2865">roll back meant enduring another Hell Week, and that was way too much to </span><span id="cant-line-2866">process. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2867">“The swelling hasn’ t gone down much. How’ s it feel?” </span><span id="cant-line-2868">The doctor was playing a role too. SEAL candidates had a don’t ask, don’t </span><span id="cant-line-2869">tell agreement with most of the medical staff at Naval Special Warfare </span><span id="cant-line-2870">Command. I wasn’ t about to make the doctor ’s job easier by revealing </span><span id="cant-line-2871">anything to him, and he wasn’ t gonna take caution’ s side and pull the rip </span><span id="cant-line-2872">cord on a man’ s dream. He lifted his hand and my pain faded. I coughed and </span><span id="cant-line-2873">pneumonia once again rattled in my lungs until I felt the cold truth of his </span><span id="cant-line-2874">stethoscope on my  skin. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2875">Ever since Hell Week was called, I’d been coughing up brown knots of </span><span id="cant-line-2876">mucus. For the first two days I lay in bed, day and night, spitting them into a </span><span id="cant-line-2877">Gatorade bottle,  where I stored  them like so many nickels. I could barely </span><span id="cant-line-2878">breathe, and couldn’ t move much either . I may have been a badmotherfucker in Hell Week, but that shit was over, and I had to deal with the </span><span id="cant-line-2879">fact that the Devil (and those instructors) branded me  too. </span><span id="cant-line-2880">“It’s all right, doc,” I said. “A little stif f is all.” </span><span id="cant-line-2881">Time is what I needed. I knew how to push through pain, and my body had </span><span id="cant-line-2882">almost always responded with performance. I wasn’ t going to quit just </span><span id="cant-line-2883">because my knee was barking. It would come around eventua lly. The doc </span><span id="cant-line-2884">prescribed medicine to reduce the congestion in my lungs and sinuses, and </span><span id="cant-line-2885">gave me some Motrin for my knee. Within two days my breathin g improved, </span><span id="cant-line-2886">but I still couldn’ t bend my right  leg. </span><span id="cant-line-2887">This would be a  problem. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2888">Of all the moments in BUD/S that I thought could break me, a knot-tying </span><span id="cant-line-2889">exercise never registered on my radar . Then again, this wasn’ t the fucking </span><span id="cant-line-2890">Boy Scouts. This was an underw ater knot-tying  drill held in the fifteen -foot </span><span id="cant-line-2891">section of the pool. And while the pool didn’ t strike mortal fear into me like </span><span id="cant-line-2892">it once did, being negatively buoyant, I knew that any pool evolution could </span><span id="cant-line-2893">be my undoing, especially those that demanded treading  water . </span><span id="cant-line-2894">Even before Hell Week, we’d been tested in the pool. We had to perform </span><span id="cant-line-2895">mock rescues on the instructors and do a fifty-meter  underwater swim </span><span id="cant-line-2896">without fins on a single breath. That swim started with a giant stride into the </span><span id="cant-line-2897">water followed by a full somersault to siphon off any momentum </span><span id="cant-line-2898">whatsoever . Then without kicking off the side, we swam along the lane lines </span><span id="cant-line-2899">to the end of our twenty -five-meter  pool. On the far side we were allowed to </span><span id="cant-line-2900">kick off the wall then swim back. When I arrived at the fifty-meter  mark I </span><span id="cant-line-2901">rose up and gasped for air. My heart hammered until my breath smoothed, </span><span id="cant-line-2902">and I grasped that I’d actually passed the first of a series of complicated </span><span id="cant-line-2903">underwater evolutions that were supposed to teach us to be calm, cool, and </span><span id="cant-line-2904">collected underwater on a breath  hold. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2905">The knot-tying  evoluti on was next in the series and it wasn’ t about our </span><span id="cant-line-2906">ability to tie various knots or a way to time our max breath hold. Sure, both </span><span id="cant-line-2907">skills come in handy on amphibian operations, but this drill was more about </span><span id="cant-line-2908">our capacity to juggle multiple stressors in an environment that’s notsustainable for human life. Despite my health, I was heading into the drill </span><span id="cant-line-2909">with some confidence. Things changed when I started treading  water . </span><span id="cant-line-2910">That’ s how the drill began, with eight students strung out across the pool, </span><span id="cant-line-2911">moving our hands and legs like egg beaters. That’ s hard enoug h for me on </span><span id="cant-line-2912">two good legs, but because my right knee didn’ t work, I was forced to tread </span><span id="cant-line-2913">water with just my left. That spiked the degree of difficulty , and my heart </span><span id="cant-line-2914">rate, which sapped my  energy. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2915">Each student had an instructor assigned to them for this evolution and </span><span id="cant-line-2916">Psycho Pete specifically requested me. It was obvious I was struggling, and </span><span id="cant-line-2917">Psycho, and his bruised pride, were hungry for a little payback. With each </span><span id="cant-line-2918">revolution of my right leg, shockwaves of pain exploded like fireworks. </span><span id="cant-line-2919">Even with Psyc ho eyeballing me, I couldn’ t hide it. When I grimaced, he </span><span id="cant-line-2920">smiled like a kid on Christmas  morning. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2921">“Tie a square knot! Then a bowline!” He shouted. I was working so hard it </span><span id="cant-line-2922">was difficult to catch my breath, but Psycho didn’ t give two fucks. “Now , </span><span id="cant-line-2923">dammit!” I gulped air , bent from the waist and kicked  down. </span><span id="cant-line-2924">There were five knots in the drill altogether and each student  was told to </span><span id="cant-line-2925">grab their eight -inch slice of rope, and tie them off one at a time at the </span><span id="cant-line-2926">bottom of the pool. We were allotted a breath in between, but could do as </span><span id="cant-line-2927">many as all five knots on a singl e breath. The instructor called out the knots, </span><span id="cant-line-2928">but the pacing was up to each student. We weren’ t allowed to use a mask or </span><span id="cant-line-2929">goggles to complete the evolut ion, and the instructor had to approve each </span><span id="cant-line-2930">knot with a thumbs up before we were permitted to surface. If they flashed a </span><span id="cant-line-2931">thumb down instead, we had to re-tie that knot correctly , and if we surfaced </span><span id="cant-line-2932">before a given knot was approved, that meant failure and a ticket  home. </span><span id="cant-line-2933">Once back at the surface, there was no resting or relaxing between tasks. </span><span id="cant-line-2934">Treading water was the constant  refrain, which meant soaring heart rates and </span><span id="cant-line-2935">the continual burning up of oxygen in the bloodstream for the one-legged </span><span id="cant-line-2936">man. Translation: the dives were uncomfortable as hell, and blacking out </span><span id="cant-line-2937">was a real  possibility . </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2938">Psycho glared at me through his mask as I worked my knots.  After about </span><span id="cant-line-2939">thirty seconds he’d approved both and we surfaced. He breathed free andeasy, but I was gasping and panting like a wet, tired dog. The pain in my </span><span id="cant-line-2940">knee was so bad I felt sweat bead up on my forehead. When you’re sweating </span><span id="cant-line-2941">in an unheated pool, you know  shit’s fucked up. I was breathless, low on </span><span id="cant-line-2942">energy, and wanted to quit, but quitting this evolution meant quitting BUD/S </span><span id="cant-line-2943">altogether , and that wasn’ t happening. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2944">“Oh no, are you hurt, Goggins? Do you have some sand in your pussy?” </span><span id="cant-line-2945">Psycho asked. “I’ll bet you can’ t do the last three knots on one  breath.” </span><span id="cant-line-2946">He said it with a smirk, like he was daring me. I knew the rules. I didn’ t have </span><span id="cant-line-2947">to accep t his challenge, but that would have made Psycho just a little too </span><span id="cant-line-2948">happy and I couldn’ t allow that. I nodded and kept treading water , delaying </span><span id="cant-line-2949">my dive until my pulse evened out and I could score one deep, nourishing </span><span id="cant-line-2950">breath. Psycho wasn’t having it. Whenever I opened my mouth he splashed </span><span id="cant-line-2951">water in my face to stress me out even more, a tactic used when trainees </span><span id="cant-line-2952">started to panic. That made breathing  impossible. </span><span id="cant-line-2953">“Go under now or you  fail!” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2954">I’d run out of time. I tried to gulp some air before my duck dive, and tasted a </span><span id="cant-line-2955">mouthful of Psycho’ s splash water instead as I dove to the bottom of the pool </span><span id="cant-line-2956">on a negative breath hold. My lungs were damn near empty which meant I </span><span id="cant-line-2957">was in pain from the jump, but I knocked the first one out in a few seconds. </span><span id="cant-line-2958">Psycho took his sweet time examining my work. My heart was thrumming </span><span id="cant-line-2959">like high alert Morse code. I felt it flip flop in my chest, like it was trying to </span><span id="cant-line-2960">break through my rib cage and fly to freedom. Psycho stared at the twine, </span><span id="cant-line-2961">flipped it over and perused it with his eyes and fingers, before offering a </span><span id="cant-line-2962">thumb’ s up in slow motion. I shook my head, untied the rope and hit the next </span><span id="cant-line-2963">one. Again he gave it a close inspection while my chest burned and </span><span id="cant-line-2964">diaphragm contracted, trying to force air into my empty lungs. The pain </span><span id="cant-line-2965">level in my knee was at a ten. Stars gathered in my peripheral vision. Those </span><span id="cant-line-2966">multiple stressor s had me teeter ing like a Jenga tower , and I felt like I was </span><span id="cant-line-2967">about to black out. If that happe ned, I’d have to depend on Psycho to swim </span><span id="cant-line-2968">me to the surface and bring me around. Did I really trust this man to do that? </span><span id="cant-line-2969">He hated me. What if he failed to execute? What if my body was too burned - </span><span id="cant-line-2970">out that even a rescue breath couldn’ t rouse  me?My mind was spun with those simple toxic questions that never go away . </span><span id="cant-line-2971">Why was I here? Why suffer when I could quit and be comfo rtable again? </span><span id="cant-line-2972">Why risk passing out or even death for a fucking knot drill? I knew that if I </span><span id="cant-line-2973">succumbed and bolted to the surface my SEAL career would  have ended </span><span id="cant-line-2974">then and there, but in that moment I couldn’ t figure out why I ever gave a </span><span id="cant-line-2975">fuck. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-2976">I looked over at Psycho. He held both thumbs up and sported a big goofy </span><span id="cant-line-2977">smile on his face like he was watching a damn comedy show . His split </span><span id="cant-line-2978">second of pleasure in my pain, reminded me of all the bullying and taunts I </span><span id="cant-line-2979">felt as a teenager , but instead of playing the victim and letting negative </span><span id="cant-line-2980">emotions sap my energy and force me to the surface, a failure, it was as if a </span><span id="cant-line-2981">new light blazed in my brain that allowed me to flip the  script. </span><span id="cant-line-2982">Time stood still as I realized for the first time that I’d always looked at my </span><span id="cant-line-2983">entire life, every thing I’d been through, from the wrong perspective. Yes, all </span><span id="cant-line-2984">the abuse I’d experienced and the negativity I had to push through </span><span id="cant-line-2985">challenged me to the core, but in that moment I stopped seeing myself as the </span><span id="cant-line-2986">victim of bad circumstance, and saw my life as the ultimate training ground </span><span id="cant-line-2987">instead. My disadvantages had been callousing my mind all along and had </span><span id="cant-line-2988">prepared me for that moment in that pool with Psycho  Pete. </span><span id="cant-line-2989">I remember my very first day in the gym back in Indiana. My palms were </span><span id="cant-line-2990">soft and quickly got torn up on the bars because they weren’ t accustomed to </span><span id="cant-line-2991">gripping steel. But over time, after thousands of reps, my palm s built up a </span><span id="cant-line-2992">thick callous as protection. The same principle works when it comes to </span><span id="cant-line-2993">mindset. Until you experience hardships like abuse and bullying, failures and </span><span id="cant-line-2994">disappointments, your mind will remain soft and exposed. Life experience, </span><span id="cant-line-2995">especially negat ive experiences, help callous the mind. But it’s up to you </span><span id="cant-line-2996">where that callous lines up. If you choose to see yourself as a victim of </span><span id="cant-line-2997">circumstance into adulthood, that callous will become resentment that </span><span id="cant-line-2998">protects you from the unfamiliar . It will make you too cautious and </span><span id="cant-line-2999">untrusting, and possibly too angry at the world. It will make you fearful of </span><span id="cant-line-3000">change and hard to reach, but not hard of mind. That’ s where I was as a </span><span id="cant-line-3001">teenager , but after my second Hell Week, I’d become someo ne new. I’d </span><span id="cant-line-3002">fought through so many horribl e situations by then and remained open and </span><span id="cant-line-3003">ready for more. My ability to stay open represented a willingnes s to fight for </span><span id="cant-line-3004">my own life, which allowed me to withstand hail storms of pain and use it tocallous over my victim’ s mentality . That shit was gone, buried under layers </span><span id="cant-line-3005">of sweat and hard fucking flesh, and I was starting to callous over my fears </span><span id="cant-line-3006">too. That realiza tion gave me the mental edge I needed to outlast Psycho </span><span id="cant-line-3007">Pete one more  time. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3008">To show him he couldn’ t hurt me anymore I smiled back, and the feeling of </span><span id="cant-line-3009">being on the edge of a blackout  went away . Suddenly , I was energized. The </span><span id="cant-line-3010">pain faded and I felt like I could stay under all day. Psycho saw that in my </span><span id="cant-line-3011">eyes. I tied off the last knot at leisurely pace, glaring at him the whole time. </span><span id="cant-line-3012">He gestured with his hands for me to hurry up as his diaphragm contracted. I </span><span id="cant-line-3013">finally finished, he gave me a quick affirmative and kicked to the surface, </span><span id="cant-line-3014">desperate for a breath. I took my time, joined him topside and found him </span><span id="cant-line-3015">gasping, while I felt strangely relaxed. When the chips were down at the </span><span id="cant-line-3016">pool during Air Force pararescue training, I’d buckled. This time I won a </span><span id="cant-line-3017">major battle in the water . It was a big victory , but the war wasn’ t over. </span><span id="cant-line-3018">After I passed the knot-tying  evolution, we had two minutes to climb out on </span><span id="cant-line-3019">to the deck, get dressed, and head back to the classroom. During  First Phase, </span><span id="cant-line-3020">that’s usually plenty of time, but a lot of us—not just me—were still healing </span><span id="cant-line-3021">from Hell Week and not moving at our typical lightning pace. On top of that, </span><span id="cant-line-3022">once we got through Hell Week, Class 231 went through a bit of an attitude </span><span id="cant-line-3023">adjustment. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3024">Hell Week is designed to show you that a human is capable of much more </span><span id="cant-line-3025">than you know . It opens your mind to the true possibilities of human </span><span id="cant-line-3026">potential, and with that comes a change in your mentality . You no longer fear </span><span id="cant-line-3027">cold water or doing push -ups all day. You realize that no matter what they do </span><span id="cant-line-3028">to you, they will never break you, so you don’t rush as much to make their </span><span id="cant-line-3029">arbitrary deadlin es. You know if you don’t make it, the instructors will beat </span><span id="cant-line-3030">you down. Meaning push -ups, getting  wet and sandy , anything to up the pain </span><span id="cant-line-3031">and discomfort quotient, but for those of us knuckle draggers still in the mix, </span><span id="cant-line-3032">our attitude was, So the fuck be it! None of us feared the instructors </span><span id="cant-line-3033">anymore, and we weren’ t about to rush. They didn’ t like that one damn  bit. </span><span id="cant-line-3034">I had seen a lot of beat downs while at BUD/S, but the one we received that </span><span id="cant-line-3035">day will go down as one of the worst in history . We did push -ups until we </span><span id="cant-line-3036">couldn’ t pick ourselves up off the deck, then they turned us on our backs and </span><span id="cant-line-3037">demanded flutte r kicks. Each kick was torture for me. I kept putting my legsdown because of the pain. I was showing weakness and if you show </span><span id="cant-line-3038">weakness, IT IS  ON! </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3039">Psycho and SBG descended and took turns on me. I went from  push -ups to </span><span id="cant-line-3040">flutter kicks to bear crawls until they got tired. I could feel the moving parts </span><span id="cant-line-3041">of my knee shifting, floating, and grabbing every time I bent it to do those </span><span id="cant-line-3042">bear crawls, and it was agonizing. I moved slower than normal and knew I </span><span id="cant-line-3043">was broken. That simple question bubbled up again. Why? What was I </span><span id="cant-line-3044">trying to prove? Quitting seemed  the sane choice. The comfort of mediocrity </span><span id="cant-line-3045">sounded like sweet relief until Psycho screamed in my  ear. </span><span id="cant-line-3046">“Move faster , motherfucker!” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3047">Once again, an amazing feeling washed over me. I wasn’ t focused on </span><span id="cant-line-3048">outdoing him this time. I was in the worst pain of my life, but my victory in </span><span id="cant-line-3049">the pool minutes before came rushing back. I’d finally proved to myself that </span><span id="cant-line-3050">I was a decent enough waterman to belong in the Navy SEALs. Heady stuff </span><span id="cant-line-3051">for a negatively buoyant kid that never took a swim lesson in his entire life. </span><span id="cant-line-3052">And the reason I got there was because I’d put in the work. The pool had </span><span id="cant-line-3053">been my kryptonite. Even though I was a far better swimmer  as a SEAL </span><span id="cant-line-3054">candidate, I was still so stressed about water evolutions that I used to hit the </span><span id="cant-line-3055">pool after a day of training at least three times a week. I scaled  the fifteen - </span><span id="cant-line-3056">foot fence just to gain after-hours  access. Other than the academic aspect, </span><span id="cant-line-3057">nothing scared me as much about the prospects of BUD/S like the swimming </span><span id="cant-line-3058">drills, and by dedicating time I was able to callous over that fear and hit new </span><span id="cant-line-3059">levels underwater when the pressure was  on. </span><span id="cant-line-3060">I though t about the incredible power of a calloused mind on task, as Psycho </span><span id="cant-line-3061">and SBG beat me down, and that thought became a feeling that took over my </span><span id="cant-line-3062">body and made me move as fast as a bear around that pool. I couldn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-3063">believe what I was doing. The intense pain was gone, and so were those </span><span id="cant-line-3064">nagging questions. I was putting out harder than ever, breaking  through the </span><span id="cant-line-3065">limitations of injury and pain tolerance, and riding a second wind delivered </span><span id="cant-line-3066">by a calloused  mind. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3067">After the bear crawls, I went back to doing flutter kicks, and I still had no </span><span id="cant-line-3068">pain! As we were leaving the pool a half-hour later, SBG asked, “Goggins, </span><span id="cant-line-3069">what got into your ass to make you Superman?”  I just smiled and left thepool. I didn’ t want to say anything because I didn’ t yet under stand what I </span><span id="cant-line-3070">now know . </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3071">Similar to using an opponent’ s energy to gain an advantage, leaning on your </span><span id="cant-line-3072">calloused mind  in the heat of battle can shift your thinking as well. </span><span id="cant-line-3073">Remembering what you’ve been through and how that has stren gthened your </span><span id="cant-line-3074">mindset can lift you out of a negative brain loop and help you bypass those </span><span id="cant-line-3075">weak, one-second  impulses to give in so you can power through obstacles. </span><span id="cant-line-3076">And when you leverage a calloused mind like I did around the pool that day </span><span id="cant-line-3077">and keep fighting through pain, it can help you push your limits because if </span><span id="cant-line-3078">you accept the pain as a natural process and refuse to give in and give up, </span><span id="cant-line-3079">you will engage the sympathetic  nervous system which shifts your hormonal </span><span id="cant-line-3080">flow. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3081">The sympathetic  nervous system is your fight or flight reflex. It’s bubbling </span><span id="cant-line-3082">just below the surface, and when you are lost, stressed out, or struggling, like </span><span id="cant-line-3083">I was when I was a down and out kid, that’s the part of your mind that’s </span><span id="cant-line-3084">driving the bus. We’ve all tasted this feeling before. Those mornings when </span><span id="cant-line-3085">going on a run is the last thing you want to do, but then twenty minutes into </span><span id="cant-line-3086">it you feel energized, that’s the work of the sympathetic nervous system. </span><span id="cant-line-3087">What I’ve found is that you can tap into it on-call as long as you know how </span><span id="cant-line-3088">to manage your own  mind. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3089">When you indulge in negative self-talk, the gifts of a sympathetic response </span><span id="cant-line-3090">will remain out of reach. How ever, if you can manage those moments of </span><span id="cant-line-3091">pain that come with maximum effort, by remembering what you’ve been </span><span id="cant-line-3092">through to get to that point in your life, you will be in a better position to </span><span id="cant-line-3093">persevere and choose fight over flight. That will allow you to use the </span><span id="cant-line-3094">adrenaline that comes with a sympathetic response to go even  harder . </span><span id="cant-line-3095">Obstacles at work and school can also be overcome with your calloused </span><span id="cant-line-3096">mind. In those cases, pushing through a given flashpoint isn’t likely to lead </span><span id="cant-line-3097">to a sympathetic response, but it will keep you motivated to push through </span><span id="cant-line-3098">any doubt you feel about your own abilities. No matter the task at hand, </span><span id="cant-line-3099">there is always opportunity for self-doubt . Whenever you decide to follow a </span><span id="cant-line-3100">dream or set a goal, you are just as likely to come up with all the reasons </span><span id="cant-line-3101">why the likelihood of success is low. Blame it on the fucked -up evolutionary </span><span id="cant-line-3102">wiring of the human mind. But you don’t have to let your doubt into thecockpit! You can tolerate doubt as a backseat driver , but if you put doubt in </span><span id="cant-line-3103">the pilot’s seat, defeat is guarant eed. Remembering that you’ve been through </span><span id="cant-line-3104">difficulties before and have always survived to fight again shifts the </span><span id="cant-line-3105">conversation in your head. It will allow you to control and manage doubt, </span><span id="cant-line-3106">and keep you focused on taking each and every step necessary to achieve the </span><span id="cant-line-3107">task at  hand. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3108">Sounds simple, right? It isn’t. Very few people even bother to try to control </span><span id="cant-line-3109">the way their thoughts and doubts bubble up. The vast major ity of us are </span><span id="cant-line-3110">slaves to our minds. Most don’t even make the first effort when it comes to </span><span id="cant-line-3111">mastering their thought process because it’s a never -ending  chore and </span><span id="cant-line-3112">impossible to get right every time. The average person thinks 2,000–3,000 </span><span id="cant-line-3113">thoughts per hour. That’ s thirty to fifty per minute! Some of those shots will </span><span id="cant-line-3114">slip by the goalie. It’ s inevitable. Especially if you coast through  life. </span><span id="cant-line-3115">Physical training  is the perfect crucible to learn how to manage your thought </span><span id="cant-line-3116">process because when you’re working out, your focus is more likely to be </span><span id="cant-line-3117">single pointed, and your respo nse to stress and pain is immediate and </span><span id="cant-line-3118">measurable. Do you hammer hard and snag that personal best like you said </span><span id="cant-line-3119">you would, or do you crumble? That decision rarely comes down to physical </span><span id="cant-line-3120">ability , it’s almost always a test of how well you are managing your own </span><span id="cant-line-3121">mind. If you push yourself throu gh each split and use that energy to maintain </span><span id="cant-line-3122">a strong  pace, you have a great  chance of recording a faster time. Granted, </span><span id="cant-line-3123">some days it’s easier to do that than others. And the clock, or the score, </span><span id="cant-line-3124">doesn’ t matter anyway . The reason it’s important to push harde st when you </span><span id="cant-line-3125">want to quit the most is because  it helps you callous your mind. It’s the same </span><span id="cant-line-3126">reason why you have to do your best work when you are the least motivated. </span><span id="cant-line-3127">That’ s why I loved PT in BUD /S and why I still love it today . Physical </span><span id="cant-line-3128">challenges stren gthen my mind so I’m ready for whatever life throws at me, </span><span id="cant-line-3129">and it will do the same for  you. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3130">But no matter how well you deploy it, a calloused mind can’t heal broken </span><span id="cant-line-3131">bones. On the mile-long hike back to the BUD/S compound, the feeling of </span><span id="cant-line-3132">victory evaporated, and I could feel the damage I’d done. I had twenty </span><span id="cant-line-3133">weeks of trainin g in front of me, dozens of evolutions ahead, and I could </span><span id="cant-line-3134">barely walk. While I wanted to deny the pain in my knee, I knew I was </span><span id="cant-line-3135">fucked so I limped straight to  medical.When he saw my knee, the doc didn’ t say a damn thing. He just shook his </span><span id="cant-line-3136">head and sent me to get an x-ray that revealed a fractured kneecap. In </span><span id="cant-line-3137">BUD/S when reservists sustain injuries that take a long time to heal, they’re </span><span id="cant-line-3138">sent home, and that’ s what happened to  me. </span><span id="cant-line-3139">I crutched my ass back to the barracks, demoralized, and while checking out, </span><span id="cant-line-3140">I saw some of the guys that quit during Hell Week. When I first glimpsed </span><span id="cant-line-3141">their helmets lined up beneath the bell, I felt sorry for them because I knew </span><span id="cant-line-3142">the empty feeling of giving up, but seeing them face to face reminded me </span><span id="cant-line-3143">that failure is a part of life and now we all had to press  on. </span><span id="cant-line-3144">I hadn’ t quit, so I knew I’d be invited back, but I had no idea if that meant a </span><span id="cant-line-3145">third Hell Week or not. Or if after getting rolled twice I still had the burning </span><span id="cant-line-3146">desire to fight through another hurricane of pain with no guarantee of </span><span id="cant-line-3147">success. Given my injury record, how could I? I left the BUD/S compound </span><span id="cant-line-3148">with more self awareness and more mastery over my mind than I’d ever had </span><span id="cant-line-3149">before, but my future was just as  uncertain. </span><span id="cant-line-3150">*** </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3151">Airplanes have always made me claustrophobic, so I decided to take the </span><span id="cant-line-3152">train from San Diego to Chicago, which gave me three full days to think, and </span><span id="cant-line-3153">my mind  was all fucked up. On the first day I didn’ t know if I wanted to be a </span><span id="cant-line-3154">SEAL anymore. I had overcome a lot. I beat Hell Week, realized the power </span><span id="cant-line-3155">of a calloused mind and conquered my fear of the water . Perhaps I’d already </span><span id="cant-line-3156">learned enough about myself? What else did I need to prove? On day two I </span><span id="cant-line-3157">thought about all the other jobs I could sign up for. Maybe I should move on </span><span id="cant-line-3158">and become a firefighter? That’ s a bad-ass job, and it would be an </span><span id="cant-line-3159">opportunity to become a different sort of hero. But on day three, as the train </span><span id="cant-line-3160">veered into Chicago, I slipped into a bathroom the size of a phone booth and </span><span id="cant-line-3161">checked in with the Accountability Mirror . Is that really how you feel? Are </span><span id="cant-line-3162">you sure you’r e ready to give up on the SEALs and become a civilian </span><span id="cant-line-3163">fireman?  I stared  at myself for five minutes before I shook my head. I </span><span id="cant-line-3164">couldn’ t lie. I had to tell myself the truth, out  loud. </span><span id="cant-line-3165">“I’m afraid. I’m afraid of going  through all of that shit again. I’m afraid of </span><span id="cant-line-3166">day one, week  one.”I was divorced by then, but my ex-wife, Pam, met me at the train station to </span><span id="cant-line-3167">drive me home to my mother ’s place in Indianapolis. Pam was still living in </span><span id="cant-line-3168">Brazil. We’d been in touch while I was in San Diego, and after seeing each </span><span id="cant-line-3169">other through the crowd on the train platform, we fell back on our habits, </span><span id="cant-line-3170">and later that night we fell into  bed. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3171">That whole summer , from May to November , I stayed in the Midwest, </span><span id="cant-line-3172">healing up then rehabbing my knee. I was still a reservist but remained </span><span id="cant-line-3173">undecided about going back to Navy SEAL training. I looked into the </span><span id="cant-line-3174">Marine Corps. I explored the application process for a handful of fire </span><span id="cant-line-3175">fighting units but finally picked up the phone, ready to call into the BUD/S </span><span id="cant-line-3176">compound. They needed my final  answer . </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3177">I sat there, holding the telephone, and thought about the misery of SEAL </span><span id="cant-line-3178">training. Shit, you run six miles a day just to eat, not including your training </span><span id="cant-line-3179">runs. I visualized all the swimming and paddling, carrying heavy -ass boats </span><span id="cant-line-3180">and logs on our heads, over the berm all day. I flashed onto hours of sit-ups, </span><span id="cant-line-3181">push -ups, flutter kicks, and the O-Course . I reme mbered the feeling of </span><span id="cant-line-3182">rolling around in the sand, of being chafed all fucking day and night. My </span><span id="cant-line-3183">memories were a mind -body  experience, and I felt the cold deep in my </span><span id="cant-line-3184">bones. A normal person would give up. They’d say, fuck it, it’s just not </span><span id="cant-line-3185">meant to be, and refuse to torture themselves one minute  more. </span><span id="cant-line-3186">But I wasn’ t wired  normal. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3187">As I dialed the number , negativ ity rose up like an angry shadow . I couldn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-3188">help but think that I was put on this earth to suffer. Why would n’t my own </span><span id="cant-line-3189">personal demons, the fates, God, or Satan, just leave me the fuck alone? I </span><span id="cant-line-3190">was tired of trying to prove myself. Tired of callousing my mind . Mentally , I </span><span id="cant-line-3191">was worn to the nub. At the same time, being worn the fuck down is the </span><span id="cant-line-3192">price of being hard and I knew if I quit, those feelings and thoughts wouldn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-3193">just go away . The cost of quittin g would be lifelong purgatory . I’d be trapped </span><span id="cant-line-3194">in the knowing that I didn’ t stay in the fight to the bitter end. There is no </span><span id="cant-line-3195">shame in gettin g knocked out. The shame comes when you throw in the </span><span id="cant-line-3196">motherfucking towel, and if I was born to suffer, then I may as well take my </span><span id="cant-line-3197">medicine.The training officer welcomed me back and confirmed that I was starting </span><span id="cant-line-3198">from day one, week one. As expected, my brown shirt would have to be </span><span id="cant-line-3199">swapped out for a white one, and he had one more sliver of sunshine to </span><span id="cant-line-3200">share. “Just so you know , Gogg ins,” he said, “this will be the last time we </span><span id="cant-line-3201">will allow you to go through BUD/S training. If you get injured, that’s it. We </span><span id="cant-line-3202">will not allow you to come back  again.” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3203">“Roger that,” I  said. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3204">Class 235 would muster in just four weeks. My knee still wasn’ t all the way </span><span id="cant-line-3205">right, but I’d better be ready because the ultimate test was about to  begin. </span><span id="cant-line-3206">Within seconds of hanging up the phone, Pam called and said she needed to </span><span id="cant-line-3207">see me. It was good timing. I was leaving town again, hopefully for good </span><span id="cant-line-3208">this time, and I needed to level with her. We’d been enjoying one another , </span><span id="cant-line-3209">but it was always a temporary thing for me. We’d been married once and we </span><span id="cant-line-3210">were still different people with totally different worldviews. That hadn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-3211">changed and obviously neither had some of my insecurities, as they kept me </span><span id="cant-line-3212">going back to what was familia r. Insanity is doing the same thing over and </span><span id="cant-line-3213">over again and expecting a different result. We would never work and it was </span><span id="cant-line-3214">time to say  so. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3215">She got to her news  first. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3216">“I’m late,” she said, as she burst through the door, clutching a brown paper </span><span id="cant-line-3217">bag. “Like late late.” She seem ed excited and nervous as she disappeared </span><span id="cant-line-3218">into the bathroo m. I could hear that bag crinkle and the tearin g open of a </span><span id="cant-line-3219">package as I lay on my bed staring at the ceiling. Minutes later, she opened </span><span id="cant-line-3220">the bathroom door, a pregnancy test in her fist and a big smile on her face. “I </span><span id="cant-line-3221">knew it,” she said, biting her lower lip. “Look, David, we’re  pregnant!” </span><span id="cant-line-3222">I stood up slow, she hugged me with everything she had, and her excitement </span><span id="cant-line-3223">broke my heart. It wasn’ t supposed to go like this. I wasn’ t ready . My body </span><span id="cant-line-3224">was still broken, I was $30,000 in credit card debt, and still only a reservist. I </span><span id="cant-line-3225">had no address of my own and no car. I was unstable,  and that made me very </span><span id="cant-line-3226">insecure. Plus, I wasn’ t even in love with this woman. That’ s what I said to </span><span id="cant-line-3227">myself while I stared into that Accountability Mirror over her shoulder . The </span><span id="cant-line-3228">mirror that never  lies.I averted my  eyes. </span><span id="cant-line-3229">Pam went home  to share the news with her parents. I walked her to the door </span><span id="cant-line-3230">of my mother ’s place, then slumped into the couch. In Coronado, I felt like </span><span id="cant-line-3231">I’d come to terms with my fucked up past and found some power there, and </span><span id="cant-line-3232">here I was sucked under once again. Now it wasn’ t just about  me and my </span><span id="cant-line-3233">dreams of becoming a SEAL. I had a family to think about, which raised the </span><span id="cant-line-3234">stakes that much higher . If I failed this time, it wouldn’ t mean that I was just </span><span id="cant-line-3235">going back to ground zero, emotionally and financially , but I would be </span><span id="cant-line-3236">bringing my new family there with me. When my mother got home I told her </span><span id="cant-line-3237">everything, and as we talked the dam broke and my fear, sadness, and </span><span id="cant-line-3238">struggle came bursting out of me. I put my head in my hands and  sobbed. </span><span id="cant-line-3239">“Mom, my life from the time I was born until now has been a nightmare. A </span><span id="cant-line-3240">nightmare that keeps getting worse,” I said. “The harder I try, the harder my </span><span id="cant-line-3241">life becomes.” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3242">“I can’ t argue with that, David,” she said. My mom knew hell and she wasn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-3243">trying to baby me. She never had. “But I also know you well enough to </span><span id="cant-line-3244">know that you will find a way to get through  this.” </span><span id="cant-line-3245">“I have to,” I said as I wiped the tears from my eyes. “I don’ t have a  choice.” </span><span id="cant-line-3246">She left me alone, and I sat on that couch all night. I felt like I’d been </span><span id="cant-line-3247">stripped of everything, but I was still breathing, which meant I had to find a </span><span id="cant-line-3248">way to keep going. I had to compartmentalize doubt and find the strength to </span><span id="cant-line-3249">believe that I was born to be more than some tired-ass Navy SEAL reject. </span><span id="cant-line-3250">After Hell Week I’d felt I had become unbreakable, yet within  a week I’d </span><span id="cant-line-3251">been zeroed out. I hadn’ t levelled up after all. I still wasn’ t shit, and if I was </span><span id="cant-line-3252">going to fix my broke -down  life, I would have to become  more! </span><span id="cant-line-3253">On that sofa, I found a  way. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3254">By then I’d learn ed how to hold myself accountable, and I knew I could take </span><span id="cant-line-3255">a man’s soul in the heat of battle. I had overcome many obstacles, and </span><span id="cant-line-3256">realized that each of those experiences had calloused my mind so thick, I </span><span id="cant-line-3257">could take on any challenge. All of that that made me feel like I’d dealt with </span><span id="cant-line-3258">my past demon s, but I hadn’ t. I’d been ignoring them. My memories ofabuse at the hands of my father , of all those people who calle d me nigger , </span><span id="cant-line-3259">didn’ t vaporize after a few victo ries. Those moments were anchored deep in </span><span id="cant-line-3260">my subconscious, and as a result, my foundation was cracked. In a human </span><span id="cant-line-3261">being your character is your foundation, and when you build a bunch of </span><span id="cant-line-3262">successes and pile up even more failures on a fucked -up foundation, the </span><span id="cant-line-3263">structure that is the self won’ t be sound. To develop an armored mind—a </span><span id="cant-line-3264">mindset so calloused and hard that it becomes bulletproof—you need to go </span><span id="cant-line-3265">to the source of all your fears and  insecurities. </span><span id="cant-line-3266">Most of us sweep our failures and evil secrets under the rug, but when we </span><span id="cant-line-3267">run into problems, that rug gets lifted up, and our darkness  re-emer ges, </span><span id="cant-line-3268">floods our soul, and influences the decisions which determine our character . </span><span id="cant-line-3269">My fears were never just about the water , and my anxieties toward Class 235 </span><span id="cant-line-3270">weren’ t about the pain of First Phase. They were seeping from the infected </span><span id="cant-line-3271">wounds I’d been walking aroun d with my entire life, and my denial of them </span><span id="cant-line-3272">amounted to a denial of myself . I was my own worst enemy! It wasn’ t the </span><span id="cant-line-3273">world, or God, or the Devil that was out to get me. It was  me! </span><span id="cant-line-3274">I was rejecting my past and therefore rejecting myself. My foundation, my </span><span id="cant-line-3275">character was defined by self-rejection . All my fears came from that deep - </span><span id="cant-line-3276">seated  uneasin ess I carried with being  David Goggins because of what I’d </span><span id="cant-line-3277">gone through. Even after I’d reached a point where I no longer cared about </span><span id="cant-line-3278">what others thought of me, I still had trouble accepting  me. </span><span id="cant-line-3279">Anyone who is of sound mind and body can sit down and think of twenty </span><span id="cant-line-3280">things in their life that could have gone differently . Where maybe they didn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-3281">get a fair shake  and where they took the path of least resistance. If you’re </span><span id="cant-line-3282">one of the few who acknowledge that, want to callous those wounds, and </span><span id="cant-line-3283">strengthen your character , its up to you to go back through your past and </span><span id="cant-line-3284">make peace with yourself by facing those incidents and all of your negative </span><span id="cant-line-3285">influences, and accepting them as weak spots in your own character . Only </span><span id="cant-line-3286">when you identify and accept your weaknesses will you finally stop running </span><span id="cant-line-3287">from your past. Then those incidents can be used more efficien tly as fuel to </span><span id="cant-line-3288">become better and grow  stronger . </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3289">Right there on mom’ s couch, as the moon burned its arc in the night sky, I </span><span id="cant-line-3290">faced down my demons. I faced myself. I couldn’ t run from my dad </span><span id="cant-line-3291">anymore. I had to accept that he was part of me and that his lying, cheatingcharacter influenced me more than I cared to admit. Before that night, I used </span><span id="cant-line-3292">to tell people that my father had died rather than tell the truth about where I </span><span id="cant-line-3293">came from. Even in the SEALs I trotted out that lie. I knew why. When you </span><span id="cant-line-3294">get beat up, you don’t want to acknowledge getting your ass kicked. It </span><span id="cant-line-3295">doesn’ t make you feel very manly, so the easiest thing to do is forget about it </span><span id="cant-line-3296">and move on. Pretend it never  happened. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3297">Not anymore. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3298">Going forward it became very important for me to rehash my life, because </span><span id="cant-line-3299">when you examine your experiences with a fine-toothed  comb and see where </span><span id="cant-line-3300">your issues come from, you can find strength in enduring pain and abuse. By </span><span id="cant-line-3301">accepting Trunnis Goggins as part of me, I was free to use where I came </span><span id="cant-line-3302">from as fuel. I realized that each episode of child abuse that could have </span><span id="cant-line-3303">killed me made me tough as hell and as sharp as a Samurai’ s blade. </span><span id="cant-line-3304">True, I had been dealt a fucked -up hand, but that night I started thinking of it </span><span id="cant-line-3305">as running a 100-mile race with a fifty-pound  ruck on my back. Could I still </span><span id="cant-line-3306">compete in that race even if everyone else was running free and easy, </span><span id="cant-line-3307">weighing 130 pounds? How fast would I be able to run once I’d shed that </span><span id="cant-line-3308">dead weight? I wasn’t even thinking about ultras yet. To me the race was life </span><span id="cant-line-3309">itself, and the more I took inventory , the more I realized how prepared I was </span><span id="cant-line-3310">for the fucked -up events yet to come. Life had put me in the fire, taken me </span><span id="cant-line-3311">out, and hammered me repeatedly , and diving back into the BUD/S cauldron, </span><span id="cant-line-3312">feeling a third Hell Week in a calendar year, would decorate me with a PhD </span><span id="cant-line-3313">in pain. I was about to become the sharpest sword ever  made! </span><span id="cant-line-3314">*** </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3315">I showed up to Class 235 on a mission and kept to myself throughout much </span><span id="cant-line-3316">of First Phase. There were 156 men in that class on day one. I still led from </span><span id="cant-line-3317">the front, but I wasn’ t about shepherding anyone through Hell Week this </span><span id="cant-line-3318">time. My knee was still sore and I needed to put every ounce of energy into </span><span id="cant-line-3319">getting my ass through BUD/S. I had everything riding on the next six </span><span id="cant-line-3320">months, and I had no illusions about how difficult it would be to make it </span><span id="cant-line-3321">through. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3322">Case in point: Shawn  Dobbs.Dobbs grew up poor in Jacksonville, Florida. He battled some of the same </span><span id="cant-line-3323">demons I did, and he came into class with a chip on his shoulder . Right </span><span id="cant-line-3324">away , I could see he was an elite, natural athlete. He was at or near the front </span><span id="cant-line-3325">on all the runs, he blitzed the O-Course  in 8:30 after just a few reps, and he </span><span id="cant-line-3326">knew  he was a bad motherfucker . Then again, like the Taoists say, those that </span><span id="cant-line-3327">know don’ t speak, and those who speak, well, they don’ t know jack  shit. </span><span id="cant-line-3328">On the night before Hell Week began he talked a lot of noise about the guys </span><span id="cant-line-3329">in Class  235. There were already fifty-five helmets  on the Grinder , and he </span><span id="cant-line-3330">was sure he’d be one of a handful of graduates at the end. He mentioned the </span><span id="cant-line-3331">guys he knew  would make it through Hell Week and also talked a lot of </span><span id="cant-line-3332">nonsense about the guys he knew  would  quit. </span><span id="cant-line-3333">He had no clue that he was making the classic mistake of measuring himself </span><span id="cant-line-3334">against others in his class. When he beat them in an evolution or </span><span id="cant-line-3335">outperformed them during PT, he took a lot of pride in that. It boosted his </span><span id="cant-line-3336">self-confidence  and his perform ance. In BUD/S, it’s common and natural to </span><span id="cant-line-3337">do some of that. It’s all part of the competitive nature of the alpha males who </span><span id="cant-line-3338">are draw n to the SEALs, but he didn’ t realize that during Hell Week you </span><span id="cant-line-3339">need a solid boat crew to survive, which means depending  upon your </span><span id="cant-line-3340">classmates, not defeating them. While he talked and talked, I took notice. He </span><span id="cant-line-3341">had no idea what was in store for him and how bad sleep deprivation and </span><span id="cant-line-3342">being cold fucks you up. He was about to find out. In the early hours of Hell </span><span id="cant-line-3343">Week, he performed well, but that same drive to defeat his classmates in </span><span id="cant-line-3344">evolutions and on timed runs came out on the  beach. </span><span id="cant-line-3345">At 5’4” and 188 pounds, Dobbs was built like a fire hydrant, but since he </span><span id="cant-line-3346">was short he was assigned to a boat crew of smaller guys referred to as </span><span id="cant-line-3347">Smurfs by the instructors. In fact, Psycho Pete made them draw  a picture of </span><span id="cant-line-3348">Papa Smurf on the front of their boat just to fuck with them. That’s the kind </span><span id="cant-line-3349">of thing our instructors did. They looked for any way to break you, and with </span><span id="cant-line-3350">Dobbs it worked . He didn’ t like being grouped up with guys he considered </span><span id="cant-line-3351">smaller and weaker , and took it out on his teammates. Over the next day he </span><span id="cant-line-3352">would grind his own crew down  before our eyes. He took up the position at </span><span id="cant-line-3353">the front of the boat or the log and set a blistering pace on the runs. Instead </span><span id="cant-line-3354">of check ing in with his crew and holding something back in reserve, he went </span><span id="cant-line-3355">all out from the jump. I reached out to him recently and he said he </span><span id="cant-line-3356">remembered BUD/S like it happened last  week.“I was grinding  an axe on my own people,” he said. “I was purposely </span><span id="cant-line-3357">beating them down, almost like if I made guys quit, it was a checkmark on </span><span id="cant-line-3358">my helmet.” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3359">By Mon day morning he’d done a decent job of it. Two of his guys had quit </span><span id="cant-line-3360">and that meant four smaller guys had to carry their boat and log by </span><span id="cant-line-3361">themselves. He admitted he was fighting his own demons on that beach. </span><span id="cant-line-3362">That his foundation was  cracked. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3363">“I was an insecure person with low self esteem trying to grind an axe,” he </span><span id="cant-line-3364">said, “and my own ego, arrogance, and insecurity made my own life more </span><span id="cant-line-3365">difficult.” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3366">Translation: his mind broke down in ways he’d never experienced before or </span><span id="cant-line-3367">since. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3368">On Mon day afternoon we did a bay swim, and when he emer ged from the </span><span id="cant-line-3369">water , he was hurting. Watchin g him it was obvious he could barely walk </span><span id="cant-line-3370">and that his mind was teetering on the brink. We locked eyes and I saw that </span><span id="cant-line-3371">he was asking himself those simple questions and couldn’ t find an answer . </span><span id="cant-line-3372">He looked a lot like I did when I was in Pararescue, searching for a way out. </span><span id="cant-line-3373">From then on Dobbs was one of the worst performers on the whole beach, </span><span id="cant-line-3374">and that fucked him up  bad. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3375">“All the people I’d categorized as lower than worms were kicking my butt,” </span><span id="cant-line-3376">he said. Soon his crew was down to two men, and he got moved to another </span><span id="cant-line-3377">boat crew with taller guys. When they lifted the boat head high, he wasn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-3378">even able to reach that motherfucker , and all of his insecurities about his size </span><span id="cant-line-3379">and his past started caving in on  him. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3380">“I started to believe that I didn’ t belong there,” he said. “That I was </span><span id="cant-line-3381">genetically inferior . It was like I had superpowers, and I’d lost them. I was in </span><span id="cant-line-3382">a place in my mind I’d never been, and I didn’ t have a road  map.” </span><span id="cant-line-3383">Think about where he was at that time. This man had excelled  through the </span><span id="cant-line-3384">first few weeks of BUD/S. He’d come from nothing and was a phenomenal </span><span id="cant-line-3385">athlete. He had so many experiences along the way he could have leaned on. </span><span id="cant-line-3386">He’d calloused his mind plenty , but because his foundation was cracked,when shit got real he lost control of his mindset and became a slave to his </span><span id="cant-line-3387">self doubt. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3388">On Mon day night, Dobbs reported to medical complaining about his feet. He </span><span id="cant-line-3389">was sure he had stress fractures,  but when he took off his boots they weren’ t </span><span id="cant-line-3390">swollen or black and blue like he’d imagined. They looked perfectly healthy . </span><span id="cant-line-3391">I know that because I was at med check too, sitting right besid e him. I saw </span><span id="cant-line-3392">his blank  stare and knew the inevitable was near. It was the look that comes </span><span id="cant-line-3393">over a man’ s face after he surrenders his soul. I had the same  look in my </span><span id="cant-line-3394">eyes when I quit Pararescue. What will forever bond me and Shawn Dobbs </span><span id="cant-line-3395">is the fact that I knew he was going to quit before he  did. </span><span id="cant-line-3396">The docs offered him Motrin  and sent him back into the suffering. I </span><span id="cant-line-3397">remember watching Shawn lace his boots, wondering at what point he would </span><span id="cant-line-3398">finally break. That’s when SBG pulled up in his truck and yelled, “This will </span><span id="cant-line-3399">be the coldest night that you will ever experience in your entire  lives!” </span><span id="cant-line-3400">I was under my boat with my crew headed toward the infamous Steel Pier </span><span id="cant-line-3401">when I glanced behind me and saw Shawn in the back of SBG’ s warm truck. </span><span id="cant-line-3402">He’d surrendered. Within minu tes he would toll the bell three times, and </span><span id="cant-line-3403">place his helmet  down. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3404">In Dobbs’ defense, this was one nightmare of a Hell Week. It rained all day </span><span id="cant-line-3405">and all night, which meant you never got warm and never got dry. Plus, </span><span id="cant-line-3406">somebody in command had the brilliant idea that the class shouldn’ t be fed </span><span id="cant-line-3407">and watered like kings at chow . Instead, we were supplied cold MREs for </span><span id="cant-line-3408">almost every meal. They thought that would test us even more. Make it more </span><span id="cant-line-3409">like a real-world  battlefield situation. It also meant there was absolutely no </span><span id="cant-line-3410">relief, and witho ut abundant calories to burn it was hard for anybody to find </span><span id="cant-line-3411">the ener gy to push through pain and exhaustion, let alone keep  warm. </span><span id="cant-line-3412">Yes, it was miserable, but I fucking loved it. I thrived off of the barbaric </span><span id="cant-line-3413">beauty of seeing the soul of a man destroyed, only to rise again and </span><span id="cant-line-3414">overcome every  obstacle in his path. By my third go ’round, I knew what the </span><span id="cant-line-3415">human body could take. I knew what I could take, and I was feeding off that </span><span id="cant-line-3416">shit. At the same time, my legs didn’ t feel right and my knee had been </span><span id="cant-line-3417">barking since day one. So far, the pain was something I could handle for at </span><span id="cant-line-3418">least a couple more days, but the thought of injury was a whole differentpiece of fuck-you pie that I had to block out of my mind. I went into a dark </span><span id="cant-line-3419">place where there was just me and the pain and suffering. I didn’ t focus on </span><span id="cant-line-3420">my class mates or my instructors. I went full caveman. I was willing to die to </span><span id="cant-line-3421">make it through that  motherfucker . </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3422">I wasn’t the only one. Late on Wednesday night, with thirty -six hours to go </span><span id="cant-line-3423">before the end of Hell Week, tragedy hit Class 235. We were in the pool for </span><span id="cant-line-3424">an evolution called the caterpill ar swim, in which each boat crew swam on </span><span id="cant-line-3425">their backs, legs locked around torsos, in a chain. We had to use our hands in </span><span id="cant-line-3426">concert to  swim. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3427">We mustered up at the pool. There were just twenty -six guys left and one of </span><span id="cant-line-3428">them was named John Skop. Mr. Skop was a specimen at 6’2” and 225 </span><span id="cant-line-3429">pounds, but he’d been sick from breakout and had been in and out of med </span><span id="cant-line-3430">check all week. While twenty -five of us stood at attention on the pool deck, </span><span id="cant-line-3431">swollen, chafed, and bleeding, he sat on the stairs by the pool, </span><span id="cant-line-3432">jackhammering in the cold. He looked like he was freezing, but waves of </span><span id="cant-line-3433">heat poured off his skin. His body was a radiator on full blast.  I could feel </span><span id="cant-line-3434">him from ten feet  away . </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3435">I’d had double pneumonia during my first Hell Week and knew what it </span><span id="cant-line-3436">looked and felt like. His alveoli, or air sacs, were filling with fluid. He </span><span id="cant-line-3437">couldn’ t clear them so he could barely breathe, which exacerbated his </span><span id="cant-line-3438">problem. When  pneumonia goes uncontrolled, it can lead to pulmonary </span><span id="cant-line-3439">edema, which can be deadly , and he was halfway  there. </span><span id="cant-line-3440">Sure enough, during the caterpillar swim, his legs went limp and he darted to </span><span id="cant-line-3441">the botto m of the pool like a doll stuffed with lead. Two instructors jumped </span><span id="cant-line-3442">in after him and from there it was chaos. They ordered us out of the water </span><span id="cant-line-3443">and lined us up along the fence  with our backs facing the pool as medics </span><span id="cant-line-3444">worked to revive Mr. Skop. We heard everything and knew his chances were </span><span id="cant-line-3445">slipping. Five minutes later, he still wasn’ t breathing, and they ordered us to </span><span id="cant-line-3446">the locker room. Mr. Skop was transported to the hospital and we were told </span><span id="cant-line-3447">to run back to the BUD/S classroom. We didn’ t know it yet, but Hell Week </span><span id="cant-line-3448">was already over . Minutes later , SBG walked in and delivered the news  cold. </span><span id="cant-line-3449">“Mr. Skop is dead,” he said. He took stock of the room. His words had been </span><span id="cant-line-3450">a collec tive gut punch to men who were already on the knife ’s edge afternearly a week with no sleep and no relief. SBG didn’ t give a fuck. “This is </span><span id="cant-line-3451">the world you live in. He’s not the first and he won’ t be the last to die in </span><span id="cant-line-3452">your line of work.” He looked over at Mr. Skop’ s roommate and said, “Mr. </span><span id="cant-line-3453">Moore, don’t steal any of his shit.” Then he left the room like it was just </span><span id="cant-line-3454">another fucked -up day. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3455">I felt torn between grief, nausea, and relief. I was sad and sick to my </span><span id="cant-line-3456">stomach that Mr. Skop had died, but we were all relieved to have survived </span><span id="cant-line-3457">Hell Week, plus the way SBG handled it was straight ahead, no bullshit, and </span><span id="cant-line-3458">I remember thinking if all SEAL s were like him, this would definitely be the </span><span id="cant-line-3459">world for me. T alk about mixed  emotions. </span><span id="cant-line-3460">See, most civilians don’t understand that you need a certain level of </span><span id="cant-line-3461">callousness to do the job we were being trained to do. To live in a brutal </span><span id="cant-line-3462">world, you have to accept cold-blooded  truths. I’m not saying it’s good . I’m </span><span id="cant-line-3463">not necessarily proud of it. But special ops is a calloused world and it </span><span id="cant-line-3464">demands a calloused  mind. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3465">Hell Week had ended thirty -six hours early . There was no pizza or brown </span><span id="cant-line-3466">shirt ceremony on the Grinder , but twenty -five men out of a possible 156 </span><span id="cant-line-3467">had made it. Once again, I was one of the few, and once again I was swollen </span><span id="cant-line-3468">like a Pillsbury doughboy and on crutches with twenty -one weeks of training </span><span id="cant-line-3469">still to come. My patella was intact, but both of my shins were slivered with </span><span id="cant-line-3470">small fractures. It gets worse. The instructors were surly because they’d been </span><span id="cant-line-3471">forced to call Hell Week prematurely , so they ended walk week after just </span><span id="cant-line-3472">forty -eight  hours. By every conceivable metric I was fucked. When I moved </span><span id="cant-line-3473">my ankle, my shins were activated and I felt searing pain, which was a </span><span id="cant-line-3474">monumental problem because a typical week in BUD/S demand s up to sixty </span><span id="cant-line-3475">miles of running. Imagine doing that on two broken  shins. </span><span id="cant-line-3476">Most of the guys in Class 235 lived on base at Naval Special Warfare </span><span id="cant-line-3477">Command in Coronado. I lived about twenty miles away in a $700 a month </span><span id="cant-line-3478">studio apartment with a mold problem in Chula Vista, which I shared with </span><span id="cant-line-3479">my pregnant wife and stepdaughter . After she got pregnant, Pam and I </span><span id="cant-line-3480">remarried, I financed a new Honda Passport—which put me roughly $60,000 </span><span id="cant-line-3481">in debt—and the three of us drove out from Indiana to San Diego to restart </span><span id="cant-line-3482">our family . I’d just cleared Hell Week for the second time in a calendar year </span><span id="cant-line-3483">and she was set to deliver our baby right around graduation, but there was nohappiness in my head or my soul. How could there be? We lived in a </span><span id="cant-line-3484">shithole that was at the edge of affordability , and my body was broken once </span><span id="cant-line-3485">again. If I couldn’ t make it through I wouldn’ t even be able to afford rent, </span><span id="cant-line-3486">would have to start all over, and find a new line of work. I could not and </span><span id="cant-line-3487">would not let that  happen. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3488">The night before First Phase kicked back up in intensity , I shaved my head </span><span id="cant-line-3489">and stared into my reflection. For almost two years straight I’d been taking </span><span id="cant-line-3490">pain to the extreme and coming back for more. I’d succeeded in spurts only </span><span id="cant-line-3491">to be buried alive in failure. That night, the only thing that allowed me to </span><span id="cant-line-3492">continue pushin g forward was the knowledge that everything I’d been </span><span id="cant-line-3493">through had helped callous my mind. The question was, how thick was the </span><span id="cant-line-3494">callous? How much pain could one man take? Did I have it in me to run on </span><span id="cant-line-3495">broken  legs? </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3496">I woke up at 3:30 the next morning and drove to the base. I limped to the </span><span id="cant-line-3497">BUD/S cage where we kept our gear and slumped onto a bench, dropping </span><span id="cant-line-3498">my backpack at my feet. It was dark as hell inside and out, and I was all </span><span id="cant-line-3499">alone. I could hear the rolling surf in the distance as I dug through my dive </span><span id="cant-line-3500">bag. Buried beneath my dive gear were two rolls of duct tape. I could only </span><span id="cant-line-3501">shake my head and smile in disbelief as I grabbed them, knowing how </span><span id="cant-line-3502">insane my plan  was. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3503">I carefully pulled a thick black tube sock over my right foot. The shin was </span><span id="cant-line-3504">tender to the touch and even the slightest twitch of the ankle joint registered </span><span id="cant-line-3505">high on the suffering scale. From there I looped the tape around my heel </span><span id="cant-line-3506">then up over my ankle and back down to my heel, eventually moving both </span><span id="cant-line-3507">down the foot and up my calf until my entire lower leg and foot were </span><span id="cant-line-3508">wrapped tight. That was just the first coat. Then I put another black tube </span><span id="cant-line-3509">sock on and taped my foot and ankle the same way. By the time I was done, </span><span id="cant-line-3510">I had two sock layers and two tape layers, and once my foot was laced up in </span><span id="cant-line-3511">the boot, my ankle and shin were protected and immobilized. Satisfied, I did </span><span id="cant-line-3512">up my left foot, and an hour later, it was as though both my lower legs were </span><span id="cant-line-3513">sunk into soft casts. It still hurt to walk, but the torture that I’d felt when my </span><span id="cant-line-3514">ankle moved was more tolerable. Or at least I thought so. I’d find out for </span><span id="cant-line-3515">sure when we started to  run.Our first training  run that day was my trial by fire, and I did the best I could </span><span id="cant-line-3516">to run with my hip flexors. Usually we let our feet and lower legs drive the </span><span id="cant-line-3517">rhythm. I had to reverse that. It took intense focus to isolate each movement </span><span id="cant-line-3518">and generate motion and power in my legs from the hip down , and for the </span><span id="cant-line-3519">first thirty minutes the pain was the worst I’d ever felt in my life. The tape </span><span id="cant-line-3520">cut into my skin, while the pounding sent shockwaves of agony up my </span><span id="cant-line-3521">slivered  shins. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3522">And this was just the first run in what promised to be five months of </span><span id="cant-line-3523">continual pain. Was it possible to survive this, day after day? I thought about </span><span id="cant-line-3524">quitting. If failure was my future and I’d have to rethink my life completely , </span><span id="cant-line-3525">what was the point of this exerc ise? Why delay the inevitable? Was I fucked </span><span id="cant-line-3526">in the head? Each and every thought boiled down to the same old simple </span><span id="cant-line-3527">question: why? </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3528">“The only way to guarantee failure is to quit right now, motherfucker!” I was </span><span id="cant-line-3529">talking to myself now. Silently screaming over the din of anguish that was </span><span id="cant-line-3530">crushing my mind and soul. “T ake the pain, or it won’ t just be your failure. It </span><span id="cant-line-3531">will be your family’ s failure!” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3532">I imagined the feeling I would have if I could actually pull this off. If I could </span><span id="cant-line-3533">endure the pain required to complete this mission. That bough t me another </span><span id="cant-line-3534">half mile before more pain rained down and swirled within  me like a </span><span id="cant-line-3535">typhoon. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3536">“People have a hard time going through BUD/S healthy , and you’re going </span><span id="cant-line-3537">through it on broken legs! Who else would even think of this?” I asked. </span><span id="cant-line-3538">“Who else would be able to run even one minute on one broken leg, let alone </span><span id="cant-line-3539">two? Only Gogg ins! You are twenty minutes in the business, Goggins! You </span><span id="cant-line-3540">are a fucking machine! Each step you run from now until the end will only </span><span id="cant-line-3541">make you  harder!” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3542">That last message cracked the code like a password. My calloused mind was </span><span id="cant-line-3543">my ticket forward, and at the forty -minute  mark something remarkable </span><span id="cant-line-3544">happened. The pain receded to low tide. The tape had loosened  so it wasn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-3545">cutting into my skin, and my muscles and bones were warm enough to take </span><span id="cant-line-3546">some pounding. The pain would come and go throughout the day, but it </span><span id="cant-line-3547">became much more manageable, and when the pain did show up, I toldmyself it was proof of how tough I was and how much tougher I was </span><span id="cant-line-3548">becoming. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3549">Day after day the same ritual played itself out. I showed up early, duct taped </span><span id="cant-line-3550">my feet, endured thirty minutes of extreme pain, talked mysel f through it, </span><span id="cant-line-3551">and survived. This was no fake-it-till-you-make -it bullshit. To me, the fact </span><span id="cant-line-3552">that I showed up every day willing to put myself through something like that </span><span id="cant-line-3553">was truly amazing. The instructors rewarded me for it too. They offered to </span><span id="cant-line-3554">bind my hands and feet and throw me in the pool to see if I could swim four </span><span id="cant-line-3555">fucking laps. In fact, they didn’ t offer. They insisted. This was one part of an </span><span id="cant-line-3556">evolution they liked to call Drown Proofing. I preferred to call it controlled </span><span id="cant-line-3557">drowning! </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3558">With our hands bound behind us and feet tied behind our back, all we could </span><span id="cant-line-3559">do is dolphin kick, and unlike some of the experienced swimmers in our </span><span id="cant-line-3560">class, who looked like they’d been pulled from the Michael Phelps gene </span><span id="cant-line-3561">pool, my dolphi n kick was that of a stationary rocking horse and provided </span><span id="cant-line-3562">about the same propulsion. I was continually out of breath, fighting to stay </span><span id="cant-line-3563">near the surface, chicken necking my head above the water to get a breath, </span><span id="cant-line-3564">only to sink down and kick hard, trying in vain to find momentum. I’d </span><span id="cant-line-3565">practiced for this. For weeks, I’d hit the pool and even experi mented with </span><span id="cant-line-3566">wetsuit shorts to see if I could hide them under my uniform to provide some </span><span id="cant-line-3567">buoyancy . They made it look like I was wearing a diaper under the tight-ass- </span><span id="cant-line-3568">nut-hugging  UDT shorts, and they didn’ t help, but all that practice did get </span><span id="cant-line-3569">me comfortable  enough with the feeling of drowning that I was able to </span><span id="cant-line-3570">endure and pass that  test. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3571">We had another brutal underwater evolution in Second Phase, aka dive </span><span id="cant-line-3572">phase. Again, it involved treading water , which always sounds basic as hell </span><span id="cant-line-3573">whenever I write it, but for this drill we were fitted with fully -charged, twin </span><span id="cant-line-3574">eighty -liter tanks and a sixteen -pound  weight belt. We had fins, but kicking </span><span id="cant-line-3575">with fins increased the pain quotient and stress on my ankles and shins. I </span><span id="cant-line-3576">couldn’ t tape up for the water . I had to suck up the  pain. </span><span id="cant-line-3577">After that we had to swim on our backs for fifty meters without sinking. </span><span id="cant-line-3578">Then flip over and swim fifty meters on our stomach, once again staying on </span><span id="cant-line-3579">the surface, all while being fully loaded! We weren’ t allowed to use anyflotation devices  whatsoever , and keeping our heads up caused intense pain </span><span id="cant-line-3580">in our necks, shoulders, hips, and lower  backs. </span><span id="cant-line-3581">The noises coming out of the pool that day are something I’ll never forget. </span><span id="cant-line-3582">Our desperate attempts to stay afloat and breathe conjured an audible </span><span id="cant-line-3583">mixture of terror , frustration, and exertion. We were gurgling, grunting, and </span><span id="cant-line-3584">gasping. I heard guttural screams and high-pitched  squeals. Several guys </span><span id="cant-line-3585">sank to the bottom, took off their weight belts, and slipped free of their </span><span id="cant-line-3586">tanks, letting them crash to the floor of the pool, then jetted to the  surface. </span><span id="cant-line-3587">Only one man passed that evolution on the first try. We only got three </span><span id="cant-line-3588">chances to pass any given evolu tion and it took me all three to pass that one. </span><span id="cant-line-3589">On my last attempt I focused on long, fluid scissor kicks, again using my </span><span id="cant-line-3590">overworked hip flexors. I barely made  it. </span><span id="cant-line-3591">By the time we got to Third Phase, the land warfare training module on San </span><span id="cant-line-3592">Clemente Island, my legs were healed up, and I knew I’d make it through to </span><span id="cant-line-3593">graduation, but just because it was the last lap doesn’ t mean it was easy. At </span><span id="cant-line-3594">the main BUD/S compound on The Strand, you get lots of looky -loos </span><span id="cant-line-3595">coming through . Officers of all stripes stop in to watch training, which </span><span id="cant-line-3596">means there are people peering over the instructors’ shoulders. On the </span><span id="cant-line-3597">island, it’s just you and them. They are free to get nasty , and they show no </span><span id="cant-line-3598">mercy . Which is exactly why I loved the  island! </span><span id="cant-line-3599">One afternoon we split into team s of two and three guys to build hide sites </span><span id="cant-line-3600">that blend in with the vegetation. We were coming down to the end by then, </span><span id="cant-line-3601">and everyone was in killer shape and unafraid. Guys were getting sloppy </span><span id="cant-line-3602">with their attention to detail and the instructors were pissed off, so they </span><span id="cant-line-3603">called everyone down into a valley to give us a classic beat  down. </span><span id="cant-line-3604">There would be push -ups, sit-ups, flutter kicks, and eight -count  bodybuilders </span><span id="cant-line-3605">(advanced burpe es) galore. But first they told us to kneel down and dig holes </span><span id="cant-line-3606">with our hands,  large enough to bury ourselves up to the neck for some </span><span id="cant-line-3607">unspecified length of time. I was smiling my ass off and diggin g deep when </span><span id="cant-line-3608">one of the instructors came up with a new , creative way to torture  me. </span><span id="cant-line-3609">“Goggins, get up. You like this shit too much.” I laughed and kept digging, </span><span id="cant-line-3610">but he was serio us. “I said get up, Goggins. You’re getting way too muchpleasure.” </span><span id="cant-line-3611">I stood up, stepped to the side, and watched my classmates suffer for the </span><span id="cant-line-3612">next thirty minutes without me. From then on the instructors stopped </span><span id="cant-line-3613">including me in their beat downs. When the class was ordered to do push - </span><span id="cant-line-3614">ups, sit-ups, or get wet and sandy , they’d always exclude me. I took it as a </span><span id="cant-line-3615">point of pride that I’d finally broken the will of the entire BUD/ S staff, but I </span><span id="cant-line-3616">also missed the beat downs. Because I saw them as opportunities to callous </span><span id="cant-line-3617">my mind. Now , they were over for  me. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3618">Considering that the Grinder was center stage for a lot of Navy SEAL </span><span id="cant-line-3619">training, it makes sense that’s where BUD/S graduation is held. Families fly </span><span id="cant-line-3620">in. Fathers and brothers puff their chests out; mothers, wives, and girlfriends </span><span id="cant-line-3621">are all done up and drop dead gor geous. Instead of pain and misery , it was all </span><span id="cant-line-3622">smiles on that patch of asphalt as the graduates of Class 235 mustered up in </span><span id="cant-line-3623">our dress whites beneath a huge American flag billowing in the sea breeze. </span><span id="cant-line-3624">To our right was the infamous bell that 130 of our classmates tolled in order </span><span id="cant-line-3625">to quit what is arguably the most challenging training in the military . Each of </span><span id="cant-line-3626">us was introduced and acknowledged individually . My mother had tears of </span><span id="cant-line-3627">joy in her eyes when my name was called, but strangely , I didn’ t feel much </span><span id="cant-line-3628">of anything, except  sadness.Mom and I at BUD/S graduation </span><span id="cant-line-3629">On the Grinder and later at McP’s—the SEAL pub of choice in downtown </span><span id="cant-line-3630">Coronado—my teammates beamed with pride as they gathered to take </span><span id="cant-line-3631">photos with their families. At the bar , music blared while everyone got drunk </span><span id="cant-line-3632">and raised hell like they’d just won something. And to be honest, that shit </span><span id="cant-line-3633">annoyed me. Because I was sorry to see BUD/S  go. </span><span id="cant-line-3634">When I first locked in on the SEALs, I was looking for an arena that would </span><span id="cant-line-3635">either destroy me completely or make me unbreakable. BUD/S provided </span><span id="cant-line-3636">that. It showed me what the human mind is capable of, and how to harness it </span><span id="cant-line-3637">to take more pain than I’d ever felt before, so I could learn to achieve things </span><span id="cant-line-3638">I never even knew were possible. Like running on broken  legs. After </span><span id="cant-line-3639">graduation it would be up to me to continue to hunt impossible tasks because </span><span id="cant-line-3640">though it was an accomplishment to become just the thirty -sixth  African </span><span id="cant-line-3641">American BUD/ S graduate in Navy SEAL history , my quest to defy the odds </span><span id="cant-line-3642">had only just  begun!CHALLENGE #5 </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3643">It’s time to visualize! Again, the average person thinks 2,000–3,000 </span><span id="cant-line-3644">thoughts per hour. Rather than focusing on bullshit you cannot change, </span><span id="cant-line-3645">imagine visualiz ing the things you can. Choose any obstacle in your way, or </span><span id="cant-line-3646">set a new goal, and visualize overcoming or achieving it. Before  I engage in </span><span id="cant-line-3647">any challenging activity , I start by painting a picture of what my success </span><span id="cant-line-3648">looks and feels like. I’ll think about it every day and that feeling propels me </span><span id="cant-line-3649">forward when I’m training, competing, or taking on any task I  choose. </span><span id="cant-line-3650">But visualization isn’t simply about daydreaming of some trophy ceremony </span><span id="cant-line-3651">—real or metaphorical. You must also visualize the challenges that are </span><span id="cant-line-3652">likely to arise and determine how you will attack those problems when they </span><span id="cant-line-3653">do. That way you can be as prepared as possible on the journ ey. When I </span><span id="cant-line-3654">show up for a foot race now, I drive the entire course first, visualizing </span><span id="cant-line-3655">success but also potential chall enges, which helps me control my thought </span><span id="cant-line-3656">process. You can’t prepare for everything but if you engage in strategic </span><span id="cant-line-3657">visualization ahead of time, you’ll be as prepared as you possibly can  be. </span><span id="cant-line-3658">That also means being prepared to answer the simple question s. Why are </span><span id="cant-line-3659">you doing this? What is driving  you toward this achievement? Where does </span><span id="cant-line-3660">the darkness you’re using as fuel come from? What has calloused your </span><span id="cant-line-3661">mind? You’ll need to have those answers at your fingertips when you hit a </span><span id="cant-line-3662">wall of pain and doubt. To push through, you’ll need to channel your </span><span id="cant-line-3663">darkness, feed of f it, and lean on your calloused  mind. </span><span id="cant-line-3664">Remember , visualization will never compensate for work undone. You </span><span id="cant-line-3665">cannot visualize lies. All the strategies I employ to answer  the simple </span><span id="cant-line-3666">questions and win the mind game are only effective because I put in work. </span><span id="cant-line-3667">It’s a lot more than mind over matter . It takes relentless self-discipline  to </span><span id="cant-line-3668">schedule sufferin g into your day, every day, but if you do, you’ll find that at </span><span id="cant-line-3669">the other end of that suf fering is a whole other life just waiting for  you.This challenge doesn’ t have to be physical, and victory doesn’t always </span><span id="cant-line-3670">mean you came in first place. It can mean you’ve finally overcome a </span><span id="cant-line-3671">lifelong fear or any other obstacle that made you surrender in the past. </span><span id="cant-line-3672">Whatever it is, tell the world your story about how you created your </span><span id="cant-line-3673">#armoredmind and where it’ s taken  you.CHAPTER SIX </span><span id="cant-line-3674">6. IT’S NOT ABOUT A TROPHY </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3675">EVER YTHING  ABOUT  THE  RACE  WAS  GOING  BETTER  THAN  I COULD  HAVE  HOPED . </span><span id="cant-line-3676">There were enough clouds in the sky to blunt the heat of the sun, my </span><span id="cant-line-3677">rhythm was as steady as the mellow tide that sloshed against the hulls of </span><span id="cant-line-3678">sailboats docked in the nearby San Diego Marina, and though my legs felt </span><span id="cant-line-3679">heavy , that was to be expected  considering my “tapering“ plan the night </span><span id="cant-line-3680">before. Besides, they seemed to be loosening up as I rounded a bend to </span><span id="cant-line-3681">complete my ninth lap—my ninth mile—just an hour and change into a </span><span id="cant-line-3682">twenty-four -hour  race. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3683">That’ s when I saw John Metz, race director of the San Dieg o One Day, </span><span id="cant-line-3684">eyeballing me at the start-finish  line. He was holding up his white board to </span><span id="cant-line-3685">inform each competitor of their time and position in the overall field. I was </span><span id="cant-line-3686">in fifth place, which evidently  confused him. I offered a crisp nod to </span><span id="cant-line-3687">reassure him that I knew what I was doing, that I was right where I was </span><span id="cant-line-3688">supposed to  be. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3689">He saw through that  shit. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3690">Metz was a veteran. Always polite and soft-spoken . It didn’ t look like there </span><span id="cant-line-3691">was much that could faze him, but he was also a seasoned ultra-marathoner </span><span id="cant-line-3692">with three fifty-mile races in his saddlebag. He’d either reached or topped a </span><span id="cant-line-3693">hundred miles, seven times, and he’d achieved his personal best of 144 </span><span id="cant-line-3694">miles in twenty -four hours when he was fifty years old! Which is why it </span><span id="cant-line-3695">meant something to me that he looked  concerned. </span><span id="cant-line-3696">I checked my watch, synced to a heart rate monitor I wore around my chest. </span><span id="cant-line-3697">My pulse straddled my magic number line: 145. A few days earlier I’d runinto my old BUD/S instructor , SBG, at Naval Special Warfare Command. </span><span id="cant-line-3698">Most SEALs do rotations as instructors between deployments, and SBG and </span><span id="cant-line-3699">I worked together . When I told him about the San Diego One Day he </span><span id="cant-line-3700">insisted I wear a heart rate monitor to pace myself. SBG was a big geek </span><span id="cant-line-3701">when it came to performance and recovery , and I watched as he scratched </span><span id="cant-line-3702">out a few formu las, then turned to me and said, “Keep your pulse steady </span><span id="cant-line-3703">between 140 and 145 and you’ll be golden.” The next day he handed me a </span><span id="cant-line-3704">heart rate monitor as a race day  gift. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3705">If you set out to mark a course that could crack open a Navy SEAL like a </span><span id="cant-line-3706">walnut, chew him up, and spit him the fuck out, San Diego’ s Hospitality </span><span id="cant-line-3707">Point would not make the cut. We’re talking about terrain so vanilla it’s </span><span id="cant-line-3708">downright serene. Tourists descend year-round  for views of San Diego’ s </span><span id="cant-line-3709">stunning marina , which spills into Mission Bay. The road is almost entirely </span><span id="cant-line-3710">smooth asphalt and perfectly flat, save a brief seven -foot incline with the </span><span id="cant-line-3711">pitch of a standard suburban driveway . There are manicured lawns, palm </span><span id="cant-line-3712">trees, and shade trees. Hospitality Point is so inviting that disabled and </span><span id="cant-line-3713">convalescing folks head there with their walkers for an afternoon’ s rehab </span><span id="cant-line-3714">stroll, all the time. But the day after John Metz chalked his easy, one-mile </span><span id="cant-line-3715">course, it became the scene of my total  destruction. </span><span id="cant-line-3716">I should have known that a breakdown was coming. By the time I started </span><span id="cant-line-3717">running at 10 a.m. on November 12, 2005, I hadn’ t run more than a mile in </span><span id="cant-line-3718">six months, but I looked like I was fit because I’d never stoppe d hitting the </span><span id="cant-line-3719">gym. While I was stationed in Iraq, on my second deployment with SEAL </span><span id="cant-line-3720">Team Five earlier that year, I’d gotten back into serious power  lifting, and </span><span id="cant-line-3721">my only dose of cardio was twenty minutes on the elliptical once a week. </span><span id="cant-line-3722">The point is, my cardiovascula r fitness was an absolute joke, and still I </span><span id="cant-line-3723">thought it was a brilliant idea to try and run a hundred miles in twenty -four </span><span id="cant-line-3724">hours. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3725">Okay , it was always a fucked -up idea, but I considered it doable because a </span><span id="cant-line-3726">hundred miles in twenty -four hours demands a pace of just under fifteen </span><span id="cant-line-3727">minutes a mile. If it came to it, I figured I could walk that fast. Only , I </span><span id="cant-line-3728">didn’ t walk. When that horn sounded at the start of the race, I took off hot </span><span id="cant-line-3729">and zoomed to the front of the pack. Exactly the right move if your race-day </span><span id="cant-line-3730">goal is to blow the fuck  up.Also, I didn’ t exactly come in well-rested . The night before the race, I </span><span id="cant-line-3731">passed by the SEAL Team Five gym on my way off base after work, and </span><span id="cant-line-3732">peeked in like I always did, just to see who was getting after it. SBG was </span><span id="cant-line-3733">inside warming up, and called  out. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3734">“Goggins,” he said, “let’s jack some fucking steel!” I laughed. He stared me </span><span id="cant-line-3735">down.  “You know , Goggins,” he said, stepping closer , “when the Vikings </span><span id="cant-line-3736">were getting ready to raid a fucking village, and they were camped out in </span><span id="cant-line-3737">the fucking woods in their godda m tents made out of fucking deer hides and </span><span id="cant-line-3738">shit, sitting around a campfire, do you think they said, Hey, let’s have some </span><span id="cant-line-3739">herbal fucking tea and call it an early night ? Or were they more like, Fuck </span><span id="cant-line-3740">that, we are going to drink some vodka made out of some mushrooms and </span><span id="cant-line-3741">get all drunked up, so the next morning when they were all hung -over and </span><span id="cant-line-3742">pissed off they would be in the ideal mood to slaughter the shit out of some </span><span id="cant-line-3743">people?” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3744">SBG could be a funny motherfucker when he wanted to be, and he could </span><span id="cant-line-3745">see me wavering, considering my options. On the one hand, that man would </span><span id="cant-line-3746">always be my BUD/S instructor and he was one of the few instructors who </span><span id="cant-line-3747">was still hard, putting out, and living the SEAL ethos every day. I’ll always </span><span id="cant-line-3748">want to impress  him. Jacking weights the night before my first 100 mile </span><span id="cant-line-3749">race would definitely impress that masochistic motherfucker . Plus, his logic </span><span id="cant-line-3750">made some fucked -up sense to me. I needed to get my mind ready to go to </span><span id="cant-line-3751">war, and lifting heavy would be my way of saying, bring on all your pain </span><span id="cant-line-3752">and mise ry, I’m ready to go! But, honestly , who does that before running a </span><span id="cant-line-3753">hundred fucking  miles? </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3754">I shook my head in disbelief, threw my bag to the ground and started </span><span id="cant-line-3755">racking weights. With heavy metal blaring from the speakers, two knuckle </span><span id="cant-line-3756">draggers came together to put the fuck out. Most of our work focused on the </span><span id="cant-line-3757">legs, including long sets of squats and dead lifts at 315 pounds. In between </span><span id="cant-line-3758">we bench pressed 225. This was a real deal power -lifting  session, and </span><span id="cant-line-3759">afterwards we sat on the bench next to one another and watched our quads </span><span id="cant-line-3760">and hamstrings quiver . It was fucking funny…until it wasn’ t. </span><span id="cant-line-3761">Ultra running has gone at least somewhat mainstream since then, but in </span><span id="cant-line-3762">2005, most ultra races—especially the San Diego One Day—were pretty </span><span id="cant-line-3763">obscure, and it was all new to me. When the majority of people think ofultras they picture trail runs through remote wilderness and don’t often </span><span id="cant-line-3764">imagine circuit races, but there were some serious runners in the field at the </span><span id="cant-line-3765">San Diego One  Day. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3766">This was the American National 24-Hour  Championship  and athletes </span><span id="cant-line-3767">descended from all over the country hoping for a trophy , a place on the </span><span id="cant-line-3768">podium, and the modest winner -take-all cash prize of, ahem, $2,000. No, </span><span id="cant-line-3769">this was not a gilded event, basking in corporate sponsorship, but it was the </span><span id="cant-line-3770">site for a team comp between the U.S. ultra-distance  national team and a </span><span id="cant-line-3771">team from Japan . Each side fielded teams of four men and four women who </span><span id="cant-line-3772">each ran for twenty -four hours. One of the top individ ual athletes in the </span><span id="cant-line-3773">field was also from Japan. Her name was Ms. Inagaki, and early on she and </span><span id="cant-line-3774">I kept  pace. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3775">Ms. Inagaki and I during San Diego 100SBG turned up to cheer me on that morning with his wife and two-year-old </span><span id="cant-line-3776">son. They huddled up on the sidelines with my new wife, Kate, who I’d </span><span id="cant-line-3777">married a few months before, a little over two years after my second </span><span id="cant-line-3778">divorce from Pam was finalized. When they saw me, they couldn’ t help but </span><span id="cant-line-3779">double over in laughter . Not just because SBG was still beat up from our </span><span id="cant-line-3780">workout the night before, and here I was trying to run a hundre d miles, but </span><span id="cant-line-3781">because of how out of place I looked. When I spoke to SBG about it not </span><span id="cant-line-3782">long ago, the scene still made him  laugh. </span><span id="cant-line-3783">“So ultra marath oners are a little weird, right,” SBG said, “and that morning </span><span id="cant-line-3784">it was like there were all these skinny ass, college professor looking, </span><span id="cant-line-3785">fucking granola eating weirdoes, and then there is this one big black dude </span><span id="cant-line-3786">who looks like a fucking linebacker from the Raiders, running around this </span><span id="cant-line-3787">track jacked the fuck up with no shirt on, and I’m thinking of that song we </span><span id="cant-line-3788">had in kinder garten… one of these things is not like the other . That was the </span><span id="cant-line-3789">song going through my head when I saw this fucking NFL linebacker </span><span id="cant-line-3790">running around this damn track  with all these skinny little nerds. I mean </span><span id="cant-line-3791">they were some hard motherfuckers, those runners. I am not taking that </span><span id="cant-line-3792">away from them, but they were all super clinical about nutrition and shit, </span><span id="cant-line-3793">and you just put a pair of shoes on and said, let’ s go!” </span><span id="cant-line-3794">He’s not wrong. I didn’ t put much thought into my race plan at all. I </span><span id="cant-line-3795">hatched it at Walmart the night before, where I bought a fold-out lawn chair </span><span id="cant-line-3796">for Kate and me to use during the race and my fuel for the entire day: one </span><span id="cant-line-3797">box of Ritz crackers and two four-packs  of Myoplex. I didn’ t drink much </span><span id="cant-line-3798">water . I didn’ t even consider my electrolyte or potassium level s or eat any </span><span id="cant-line-3799">fresh fruit. SBG  brought me a pack of Hostess chocolate donu ts when he </span><span id="cant-line-3800">showed up, and I gobbled those in a few seconds. I mean, I was winging it </span><span id="cant-line-3801">for real. Yet, at mile fifteen I was still in fifth place, still keeping pace with </span><span id="cant-line-3802">Ms. Inagaki, while Metz was getting more and more nervous. He ran up to </span><span id="cant-line-3803">me and tagged  along. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3804">“You should slow down, David,” he said, “Pace yourself a bit  more.” </span><span id="cant-line-3805">I shrugged. “I got  this.” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3806">It’s true that I felt okay in that moment, but my bravado was also a defense </span><span id="cant-line-3807">mechanism. I knew if I were to start planning my race at that point, thebigness of it would become too much to comprehend. It woul d feel like I </span><span id="cant-line-3808">was supposed to run the length of the damn sky . It would feel impossible. In </span><span id="cant-line-3809">my mind, strategy was the enem y of the moment, which is where I needed </span><span id="cant-line-3810">to be. Translation: when it came  to ultras, I was green as fuck. Metz didn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-3811">press me, but he kept a close  watch. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3812">I finishe d mile twenty -five at about the four-hour mark and I was still in </span><span id="cant-line-3813">fifth place, still running with my new Japanese friend. SBG was long gone, </span><span id="cant-line-3814">and Kate was my only support crew . I’d see her every mile, posted up in </span><span id="cant-line-3815">that lawn chair , offering a sip of Myoplex and an encouraging  smile. </span><span id="cant-line-3816">I’d run a marathon only once before, while I was stationed in Guam. It was </span><span id="cant-line-3817">unofficial, and I ran it with a fellow SEAL on a course we made up on the </span><span id="cant-line-3818">spot, but back then I was in excellent cardiovascular shape. Now , here I was </span><span id="cant-line-3819">bearing down on 26.2 miles for just the second time in my entire life, this </span><span id="cant-line-3820">time without training, and once I got there I realized that I’d run beyond </span><span id="cant-line-3821">known territory . I had twenty more hours and nearly three more marathons </span><span id="cant-line-3822">to go. Those were incomprehen sible metrics, with no traditional milestone </span><span id="cant-line-3823">in between to focus on. I was running across the sky. That’ s when I started </span><span id="cant-line-3824">thinking that this could end  badly . </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3825">Metz didn’ t stop trying to help. Each mile he’d run alongside and check on </span><span id="cant-line-3826">me, and me being who I am, I told him that I had everything under control </span><span id="cant-line-3827">and had it all figured out. Which was true. I’d figured out that John Metz </span><span id="cant-line-3828">knew what the fuck he was talking  about. </span><span id="cant-line-3829">Oh yes, the pain was becoming real. My quads throbbed, my feet were </span><span id="cant-line-3830">chafed and bleeding, and that simple question was once again bubbling up </span><span id="cant-line-3831">in my frontal lobe. Why? Why run a hundr ed fucking miles without </span><span id="cant-line-3832">training? Why was I doing this to myself? Fair questions, especially since I </span><span id="cant-line-3833">hadn’ t even heard of the San Diego One Day until three days before race </span><span id="cant-line-3834">day, but this time my answer was different. I wasn’ t on Hospitality Point to </span><span id="cant-line-3835">deal with my own demons or to prove anything at all. I came with a purpose </span><span id="cant-line-3836">bigger than David Goggins. This fight was about my once and future fallen </span><span id="cant-line-3837">teammates, and the families they leave behind when shit goes  wrong. </span><span id="cant-line-3838">Or at least that’ s what I told myself at mile twenty -seven .*** </span><span id="cant-line-3839">I had gotten the news about Operation Red Wings, a doomed operation in </span><span id="cant-line-3840">the remote mountains of Afghan istan, on my last day of U.S. Army Freefall </span><span id="cant-line-3841">school in Yuma, Arizona, in June. Operation Red Wings was a four-man </span><span id="cant-line-3842">reconnaissance mission tasked with gathering intelligence on a growing </span><span id="cant-line-3843">pro-Taliban  force in a region called Sawta lo Sar. If successful, what they </span><span id="cant-line-3844">learned would help define strategy for a larger offensive in the coming </span><span id="cant-line-3845">weeks. I knew all four  guys. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3846">Danny Dietz was in BUD/S Class 231 with me. He got injured and rolled </span><span id="cant-line-3847">just like I did. Michael Murphy , the OIC of the mission, was with me in </span><span id="cant-line-3848">Class 235 before  he got rolled. Matthew Axelson was in my Hooyah Class </span><span id="cant-line-3849">when I graduated (more on the Hooyah Class tradition in a moment), and </span><span id="cant-line-3850">Marcus Luttrell was one of the first people I met on my original lap through </span><span id="cant-line-3851">BUD/S. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3852">Before training begins, each incoming BUD/S class throws a party, and the </span><span id="cant-line-3853">guys from previous classes who are still in BUD/S training are always </span><span id="cant-line-3854">invited. The idea is to juice as much information from brown shirts as </span><span id="cant-line-3855">possible, becaus e you never know what might help get you through a </span><span id="cant-line-3856">crucial evolution  that could make all the difference between graduation and </span><span id="cant-line-3857">failure. Marcus was 6’4”, 225 pounds, and he stuck out in that crowd like I </span><span id="cant-line-3858">did. I was a bigger guy too, back up to 210 by then, and he sought me out. </span><span id="cant-line-3859">In some ways we were an odd pair. He was a hard-ass axe handle from the </span><span id="cant-line-3860">Texas rangeland , and I was a self-made  masochist from the Indiana </span><span id="cant-line-3861">cornfields, but he’d heard I was a good runner , and running was his main </span><span id="cant-line-3862">weakness. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3863">“Goggins, do you have any tips for me?” he asked. “Because I can’t run for </span><span id="cant-line-3864">shit.” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3865">I knew Marcus was a badass, but his humility made him real. When he </span><span id="cant-line-3866">graduated a few days later, we were his Hooyah Class, which meant we </span><span id="cant-line-3867">were the first people they were allowed to order around. They embraced </span><span id="cant-line-3868">that SEAL tradition and told us to go get wet and sandy . It was a SEAL ’s </span><span id="cant-line-3869">rite of passage, and an honor to share that with him. After that I didn’ t see </span><span id="cant-line-3870">him for a long  time.I thought I ran into him again when I was about to graduate with Class 235, </span><span id="cant-line-3871">but it was his twin brother , Morgan Luttrell, who was part of my Hooyah </span><span id="cant-line-3872">Class, Class 237, along with Matthew Axelson. We could have ordered up </span><span id="cant-line-3873">some poetic justice, but after we graduated, instead of telling their class to </span><span id="cant-line-3874">go get wet and sandy , we put ourselves in the surf, in our dress  whites! </span><span id="cant-line-3875">I had something to do with  that. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3876">In the Navy SEALs, you are either deployed and operating in the field, </span><span id="cant-line-3877">instructing other SEALs, or in school yourself, learning or perfecting skills. </span><span id="cant-line-3878">We cycle through more military schools than most because we are trained to </span><span id="cant-line-3879">do it all, but when I went through BUD/S we didn’ t learn to freefall. We </span><span id="cant-line-3880">jumped by static lines, which deployed our chutes automatically . Back then </span><span id="cant-line-3881">you had to be chosen to attend U.S. Army Freefall School. After my second </span><span id="cant-line-3882">platoon, I was picked up for Green T eam which is one of the training phases </span><span id="cant-line-3883">to get accepted into the Naval Special Warfare Development Group </span><span id="cant-line-3884">(DEVGRU), an elite unit within the SEALs. That required me to get freefall </span><span id="cant-line-3885">qualified. It also required that I face my fear of heights in the most </span><span id="cant-line-3886">confrontational way  possible. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3887">We started off in the classrooms and wind tunnels of Fort Bragg, North </span><span id="cant-line-3888">Carolina, which  is where I reconnected with Morgan in 2005. Floating on a </span><span id="cant-line-3889">bed of compress ed air in a fifteen -foot-high wind tunnel, we learned correct </span><span id="cant-line-3890">body position, how to shift left and right, and push forward and back. It </span><span id="cant-line-3891">takes very small movements with your palm to move and it’s easy to start </span><span id="cant-line-3892">spinning out of control, which is never good. Not everyone could master </span><span id="cant-line-3893">those subtleties but those of us who could left Fort Bragg after that first </span><span id="cant-line-3894">week of training and headed to an airstrip in the cactus fields of Yuma to </span><span id="cant-line-3895">start jumping for  real. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3896">Morgan and I trained and hung out together for four weeks in the 127- </span><span id="cant-line-3897">degree  desert heat of summer . We did dozens of jumps out of C130 </span><span id="cant-line-3898">transport jets from altitudes ranging from 12,500 to 19,000 feet, and there is </span><span id="cant-line-3899">no rush like the surge of adrenaline and paranoia that comes with </span><span id="cant-line-3900">plummeting to earth from high altitude at terminal velocity . Each time we </span><span id="cant-line-3901">jumped I couldn’ t help but think of Scott Gearen, the Pararescuman who </span><span id="cant-line-3902">survived a botched jump from high altitude and inspired me on this path </span><span id="cant-line-3903">when I met him as a high school student. He was a constant presence for mein that desert, and a cautionary tale. Proof that something can go horribly </span><span id="cant-line-3904">wrong on any given  jump. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3905">When I jumped out of an airplane for the first time from high altitude, all I </span><span id="cant-line-3906">felt was extreme fear, and I couldn’ t pry my eyes from my altimeter . I </span><span id="cant-line-3907">wasn’ t able to embrace the jump because fear had clogged my mind. All I </span><span id="cant-line-3908">could think about was whether or not my canopy would open. I was missing </span><span id="cant-line-3909">the unbelievable thrill -ride of the freefall, the beauty of the mountains </span><span id="cant-line-3910">painted against the horizon, and the wide -open  sky. But as I became </span><span id="cant-line-3911">conditioned to the risk, my tolerance for that same fear increased. It was </span><span id="cant-line-3912">always there, but I was used to the discomfort and before long I was able to </span><span id="cant-line-3913">handle multiple tasks on a jump and appreciate the moment  too. Seven </span><span id="cant-line-3914">years earlier I had been rooting around fast food kitchens and open </span><span id="cant-line-3915">dumpsters zapping vermin. Now I was fucking  flying! </span><span id="cant-line-3916">The final task in Yuma was a midnight jump in full kit. We were weighed </span><span id="cant-line-3917">down with a fifty-pound  rucksack, strapped with a rifle and an oxygen mask </span><span id="cant-line-3918">for the freefall. We were also equipped with chem lights, which were a </span><span id="cant-line-3919">necessity because when the back ramp of the C-130 opened up, it was pitch </span><span id="cant-line-3920">black. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3921">We couldn’ t see any damn thing , but still we leapt into that moonless sky, </span><span id="cant-line-3922">eight of us in a line, one after another . We were supposed to form an arrow , </span><span id="cant-line-3923">and as I maneuvered through the real-world  wind tunnel to take my place in </span><span id="cant-line-3924">the grand design, all I could see were swerving lights streaking like comets </span><span id="cant-line-3925">in an inkwell sky. My goggles fogged up as the wind ripped through me. </span><span id="cant-line-3926">We fell for a full minute, and when we deployed our chutes at around 4,000 </span><span id="cant-line-3927">feet, the overpow ering sound went from full tornado to eerie silence. It was </span><span id="cant-line-3928">so quiet I could hear my heart beat through my chest. It was fucking bliss, </span><span id="cant-line-3929">and when we all landed safely , we were freefall qualified! We had no idea </span><span id="cant-line-3930">that at that moment, in the mountains of Afghanistan, Marcus and his team </span><span id="cant-line-3931">were locked into an all-out battle for their lives, at the center of what would </span><span id="cant-line-3932">become the worst incident in SEAL  history . </span><span id="cant-line-3933">One of the best things about Y uma is that you have horrible cell service. I’m </span><span id="cant-line-3934">not big on texting or talking on the phone so this gave me four weeks of </span><span id="cant-line-3935">peace. When you graduate any military school, the last thing you do is clean </span><span id="cant-line-3936">all the areas your class used until it’s like you were never  there. Mycleaning detail was in charge of the bathrooms, which happene d to be one </span><span id="cant-line-3937">of the only place s in Yuma that has cell service, and as soon as I walked in I </span><span id="cant-line-3938">could hear my phone blow up. Text messages about Operation Red Wings </span><span id="cant-line-3939">going bad flooded in, and as I read them my soul broke. Morgan hadn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-3940">heard anything about it yet, so I walked outside, found him, and told him </span><span id="cant-line-3941">the news. I had to. Marcus and his crew were all MIA and presumed KIA. </span><span id="cant-line-3942">He nodded, considered it for a second, and said, “My brother ’s not  dead.” </span><span id="cant-line-3943">Morgan is seven minutes older than Marcus. They were inseparable as kids, </span><span id="cant-line-3944">and the first time they’d ever been apart for longer than a day was when </span><span id="cant-line-3945">Marcus joined the Navy . Morgan opted for college before joining up, and </span><span id="cant-line-3946">during Marcus’ Hell Week, he tried to stay up the whole time in solidarity . </span><span id="cant-line-3947">He want ed and needed to share that feeling, but there is no such thing as a </span><span id="cant-line-3948">Hell Week simulation. You have to go through it to know it, and those that </span><span id="cant-line-3949">survive are forever changed. In fact, the period after Marcus survived Hell </span><span id="cant-line-3950">Week and befor e Morgan became a SEAL himself was the only time there </span><span id="cant-line-3951">was any emotional distance between the brothers, which speaks to the </span><span id="cant-line-3952">power of those 130 hours and their emotional toll. Once Morgan went </span><span id="cant-line-3953">through it for real, everything was right again. They each have half a </span><span id="cant-line-3954">Trident tattooed  on their back. The picture is only complete  when they </span><span id="cant-line-3955">stand side by  side. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3956">Morgan took off immediately to drive to San Diego and figure out what the </span><span id="cant-line-3957">hell was going on. He still hadn’ t heard anything about the operation </span><span id="cant-line-3958">directly , but once he reached civilization and his service hit, a tide of </span><span id="cant-line-3959">messages flooded his phone too. He floored his rental car to 120 mph and </span><span id="cant-line-3960">zoomed directly to the base in  Coronado. </span><span id="cant-line-3961">Morgan knew all the guys in his brother ’s unit well. Axelson was his </span><span id="cant-line-3962">classmate in BUD/S, and as facts trickled in it was obvious to most that his </span><span id="cant-line-3963">brother wouldn’ t be found alive . I thought he was gone too, but you know </span><span id="cant-line-3964">what they say about  twins. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3965">“I knew my brother was out there, alive,” Morgan told me when we </span><span id="cant-line-3966">connected again in April 2018. “I said that the whole  time.” </span><span id="cant-line-3967">I’d called Morgan to talk about old times and asked him about the hardest </span><span id="cant-line-3968">week in his life. From San Diego, he flew out to his family’ s ranch inHuntsville, Texas, where they were getting updates twice a day. Dozens of </span><span id="cant-line-3969">fellow SEALs turned up to show support, Morgan said, and for five long </span><span id="cant-line-3970">days, he and his family cried themselves to sleep at night. To them it was </span><span id="cant-line-3971">torture knowing that Marcus might be alive and alone in hostile territory . </span><span id="cant-line-3972">When officials from the Pentag on arrived, Morgan made himself clear as </span><span id="cant-line-3973">cut glass, “[Marcus] may be hurt and fucked up, but he’s alive  and either </span><span id="cant-line-3974">you go out there and find him, or I  will!” </span><span id="cant-line-3975">Operation Red Wings went horribly wrong because there were many more </span><span id="cant-line-3976">pro-Taliban  hajjis active in those mountains than had been expected, and </span><span id="cant-line-3977">once Marcus and his team were discovered by villagers there, it was four </span><span id="cant-line-3978">guys against a well-armed  militia of somewhere betwee n 30–200 men </span><span id="cant-line-3979">(reports on the size of the pro-Taliban  force vary). Our guys took RPG and </span><span id="cant-line-3980">machine gun fire, and fought hard. Four SEALs can put on a hell of a show . </span><span id="cant-line-3981">Each one of us can usually do as much damage as five regular  troops, and </span><span id="cant-line-3982">they made their presence  felt. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3983">The battle played out along a ridgeline above 9,000 feet in elevation, where </span><span id="cant-line-3984">they had communication trouble s. When they finally broke through and the </span><span id="cant-line-3985">situation was made plain to their commanding officer back at special </span><span id="cant-line-3986">operations head quarters, a quick reaction force of Navy SEALs, marines, </span><span id="cant-line-3987">and aviators from 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment was </span><span id="cant-line-3988">assembled, but they were delayed for hours because of lack of transport </span><span id="cant-line-3989">capacity . One thing about the SEAL teams is we don’t have our own </span><span id="cant-line-3990">transport. In Afghanistan we hitch rides with the Army , and that delayed </span><span id="cant-line-3991">relief. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-3992">They eventually loaded up into two Chinook transport choppers and four </span><span id="cant-line-3993">attack helicopte rs (two Black Hawks and two Apaches) and took off for </span><span id="cant-line-3994">Sawtalo Sar. The Chinooks took the lead, and as they closed in on the ridge, </span><span id="cant-line-3995">they were hit by small arms fire. Despite the onslaught, the first Chinook </span><span id="cant-line-3996">hovered, attempting to unload eight Navy SEALs on a mountain top, but </span><span id="cant-line-3997">they made a fat target, lingered too long, and were hit with a rocket </span><span id="cant-line-3998">propelled grenad e. The bird spun, crashed into the mountain, and exploded. </span><span id="cant-line-3999">Everyone aboard was killed. The remaining choppers bailed out, and by the </span><span id="cant-line-4000">time they could return with ground assets, everyone who was left behind,including Marcus’ three teamm ates on Operation Red Wings, was found </span><span id="cant-line-4001">dead. Everyone, that is, except for  Marcus. </span><span id="cant-line-4002">Marcus was hit multiple times  by enemy fire and went missing for five </span><span id="cant-line-4003">days. He was saved by Afghan villagers who nursed and sheltered him, and </span><span id="cant-line-4004">was finally found alive by U.S. troops on July 3, 2005, when he became the </span><span id="cant-line-4005">lone survivor of a mission that took the lives of nineteen special operations </span><span id="cant-line-4006">warriors, including eleven Navy  SEALs. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4007">No doub t, you’v e heard this story before. Marcus wrote a bestselling book </span><span id="cant-line-4008">about it, Lone Survivor , which became a hit movie starring Mark Wahlber g. </span><span id="cant-line-4009">But in 2005, that was all years away , and in the aftermath of the worst </span><span id="cant-line-4010">battlefield loss ever to hit the SEALs, I was looking for a way to contribute </span><span id="cant-line-4011">to the families of the men who were killed. It’s not like bills stop rolling in </span><span id="cant-line-4012">after a tragedy like that. There were wives and kids out there  with basic </span><span id="cant-line-4013">needs to fulfill, and eventually they’d need their college educations covered </span><span id="cant-line-4014">too. I wanted to help in any way I  could. </span><span id="cant-line-4015">A few weeks before all of this, I’d spent an evening Googling  around for </span><span id="cant-line-4016">the world’ s toughest foot races and landed on a race called Badwater 135. </span><span id="cant-line-4017">I’d never even heard of ultra marathons before, and Badwater was an ultra </span><span id="cant-line-4018">marathoner ’s ultra marathon. It started below sea level in Death Valley and </span><span id="cant-line-4019">finished at the end of the road at Mount Whitney Portal, a trailh ead located </span><span id="cant-line-4020">at 8,374  feet. Oh, and the race takes place in late July, when Death Valley </span><span id="cant-line-4021">isn’t just the lowest place on Earth. It’ s also the  hottest. </span><span id="cant-line-4022">Seeing images from that race materialize on my monitor terrified and </span><span id="cant-line-4023">thrilled me. The terrain looked all kinds of harsh, and the expressions on </span><span id="cant-line-4024">tortured runners’ faces reminded me of the kind of thing I saw in Hell </span><span id="cant-line-4025">Week. Until then, I’d always considered the marathon to be the pinnacle of </span><span id="cant-line-4026">endurance racing , and now I was seeing there were several levels beyond it. </span><span id="cant-line-4027">I filed the information away and figured I’d come back to it  someday . </span><span id="cant-line-4028">Then Operation Red Wings happened, and I vowed to run Badwater 135 to </span><span id="cant-line-4029">raise money for the Special Operations Warrior Foundation, a non-profit </span><span id="cant-line-4030">founded as a battlefield promise in 1980, when eight special operations </span><span id="cant-line-4031">warriors died in a helicopter crash during the famous hostage rescue </span><span id="cant-line-4032">operation in Iran and left seventeen children behind. The survivingservicemen prom ised to make sure each one of those kids had the money to </span><span id="cant-line-4033">go to college. Their work continues. Within thirty days of a fatality , like </span><span id="cant-line-4034">those that occurred during Operation Red Wings, the foundation’ s </span><span id="cant-line-4035">hardworking staf f reach out to surviving family  members. </span><span id="cant-line-4036">“We are the interfering aunt,” said Executive Director Edie Rosenthal. “We </span><span id="cant-line-4037">become a part of our students’ lives.” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4038">They pay for preschool and private tutoring during grade school. They </span><span id="cant-line-4039">arrange college visits and host peer support groups. They help with </span><span id="cant-line-4040">applications, buy books, laptop computers, and printers, and cover tuition at </span><span id="cant-line-4041">whichever schoo l one of their students manages to gain acceptance, not to </span><span id="cant-line-4042">mention room and board. They also send students to vocational schools. It’s </span><span id="cant-line-4043">all up to the kids. As I write this, the foundation has 1,280 kids in their </span><span id="cant-line-4044">program. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4045">They are an amazing organization, and with them in mind, I called Chris </span><span id="cant-line-4046">Kostman, Race Director of Badwater 135, at 7 a.m. in mid-November , </span><span id="cant-line-4047">2005. I tried to introduce mysel f, but he cut me off, sharp. “Do you know </span><span id="cant-line-4048">what time it is?!” he  snapped. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4049">I took the phone away from my ear and stared at it for a second. In those </span><span id="cant-line-4050">days, by 7 a.m. on a typical weekday I’d have already rocked a two-hour </span><span id="cant-line-4051">gym workout and was ready for a day’s work. This dude was half asleep. </span><span id="cant-line-4052">“Roger that,” I said. “I’ll call you back at  0900.” </span><span id="cant-line-4053">My second call didn’ t go much better , but at least he knew who I was. SBG </span><span id="cant-line-4054">and I had already discussed Badwater and he’d emailed Kostma n a letter of </span><span id="cant-line-4055">recommendation. SBG has raced triathlons, captained a team through the </span><span id="cant-line-4056">Eco-Challenge , and watched several Olympic qualifiers attempt BUD/S. In </span><span id="cant-line-4057">his emai l to Kostman, he wrote  that I was the “best endurance athlete with </span><span id="cant-line-4058">the greatest mental toughness” he’d ever seen. To put me, a kid who came </span><span id="cant-line-4059">from nothing, at the top of his list meant the world to me and still  does. </span><span id="cant-line-4060">It didn’ t mean shit to Chris Kostman. He was the definition of unimpressed. </span><span id="cant-line-4061">The kind of unimpressed that can only come from real-world  experience. </span><span id="cant-line-4062">When he was twenty years old he’d competed in the Race Acro ss America </span><span id="cant-line-4063">bicycle race, and before taking over as Badwater race directo r, he’d runthree 100-mile races in winter in Alaska and completed a triple Ironman </span><span id="cant-line-4064">triathlon, which ends with a seventy -eight -mile run. Along the way, he’d </span><span id="cant-line-4065">seen dozens of supposedly great athletes crumble beneath the anvil of  ultra. </span><span id="cant-line-4066">Weekend warriors sign up for and complete marathons after a few months’ </span><span id="cant-line-4067">training all the time, but the gap between marathon running and becoming </span><span id="cant-line-4068">an ultra athlete is much wider , and Badwater was the absolute apex of the </span><span id="cant-line-4069">ultra universe. In 2005, there were approximately twenty -two 100-mile </span><span id="cant-line-4070">races held in the United States, and none had the combination of the </span><span id="cant-line-4071">elevation gain and unfor giving heat that Badwater 135 brought to the table. </span><span id="cant-line-4072">Just to put on the race, Kostman had to wrangle permissions and assistance </span><span id="cant-line-4073">from five government agencies, including the National Forest Service, the </span><span id="cant-line-4074">National Park Service, and the California Highway Patrol, and he knew that </span><span id="cant-line-4075">if he allowed some greenhorn into the most difficult race ever conceived, in </span><span id="cant-line-4076">the middle of summer , that motherfucker might die, and his race would </span><span id="cant-line-4077">vaporize overnight. No, if he was going to let me compete in Badwater , I </span><span id="cant-line-4078">was going to have to earn it. Because earning my way in would provide him </span><span id="cant-line-4079">at least some comfort that I probably wouldn’ t collapse into a steaming pile </span><span id="cant-line-4080">of road kill somewhere between Death V alley and Mount  Whitney . </span><span id="cant-line-4081">In his email, SBG attempted to make a case that because I was busy </span><span id="cant-line-4082">working as a SEAL, the prerequisites required to compete at Badwater—the </span><span id="cant-line-4083">completion of at least one 100-mile race or one twenty -four-hour race, </span><span id="cant-line-4084">while covering at least one hundred miles—should be waived. If I was </span><span id="cant-line-4085">allowed in, SBG guaranteed him that I’d finish in the top ten. Kostman </span><span id="cant-line-4086">wasn’ t having any of it. He’d had accomplished athletes beg him to waive </span><span id="cant-line-4087">his standards over the years, including a champion marathoner and a </span><span id="cant-line-4088">champion sumo wrestler (yeah, no shit), and he’d never  budged. </span><span id="cant-line-4089">“One thing abou t me is, I’m the same with everyone,” Kostman said when I </span><span id="cant-line-4090">called him back . “We have certain standards for getting into our race, and </span><span id="cant-line-4091">that’s the way it is. But hey, there’s this twenty -four-hour race in San Diego </span><span id="cant-line-4092">coming up this weekend,” he continued, his voice dripping with sarcasm. </span><span id="cant-line-4093">“Go run one hundred miles and get back to  me.” </span><span id="cant-line-4094">Chris Kostman had made me. I was as unprepared as he suspect ed. The fact </span><span id="cant-line-4095">that I wanted to run Badwater was no lie, and I planned to train for it, but to </span><span id="cant-line-4096">even have a chance to do that I’d have to run one hundred miles at the dropof a damn hat. If I chose not to, after all that Navy SEAL bluster , what </span><span id="cant-line-4097">would that prove? That I was just another pretender ringing his bell way too </span><span id="cant-line-4098">early on a Wednesday morning. Which is how and why I wound up running </span><span id="cant-line-4099">the San Diego One Day with three days’ notice. </span><span id="cant-line-4100">*** </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4101">After surpassing the fifty-mile mark, I could no longer keep up with Ms. </span><span id="cant-line-4102">Inagaki, who bounded ahead like a damn rabbit. I soldiered on in a fugue </span><span id="cant-line-4103">state. Pain washed through me in waves. My thighs felt like they were </span><span id="cant-line-4104">loaded with lead. The heavier they got the more twisted my stride became. I </span><span id="cant-line-4105">torqued my hips to keep my legs moving and fought gravity to lift my feet a </span><span id="cant-line-4106">mere millimeter from the earth. Ah, yes, my feet. My bones were becoming </span><span id="cant-line-4107">more brittle by the second, and my toes had banged the tips of my shoes for </span><span id="cant-line-4108">nearly ten hours. Still, I fucking ran. Not fast. Not with much style. But I </span><span id="cant-line-4109">kept going. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4110">My shins were the next domin o to fall. Each subtle rotation of the ankle </span><span id="cant-line-4111">joint felt like shock therapy—like venom flowing through the marrow of </span><span id="cant-line-4112">my tibia. It brought back memories of my duct tape days from Class 235, </span><span id="cant-line-4113">but I didn’ t bring any tape with me this time. Besides, if I stopp ed for even </span><span id="cant-line-4114">a few seconds, starting up again would be near  impossible. </span><span id="cant-line-4115">A few miles later, my lungs seized, and my chest rattled as I hocked up </span><span id="cant-line-4116">knots of brown mucus. It got cold. I became short of breath. Fog gathered </span><span id="cant-line-4117">around the halogen street lights , ringing the lamps with electri c rainbows, </span><span id="cant-line-4118">which lent the whole event an otherworldly feel. Or maybe it was just me in </span><span id="cant-line-4119">that other world . One in which  pain was the mother tongue,  a language </span><span id="cant-line-4120">synced to  memory . </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4121">With every lung-scraping  cough I flashed to my first BUD/S class. I was </span><span id="cant-line-4122">back on the motherfucking log, staggering ahead, my lungs bleeding. I </span><span id="cant-line-4123">could feel and see it happening all over again. Was I asleep? Was I </span><span id="cant-line-4124">dreaming? I opened my eyes wide, pulled my ears and slapped my face to </span><span id="cant-line-4125">wake up. I felt my lips and chin for fresh blood, and found a translucent </span><span id="cant-line-4126">slick of saliva, sweat, and mucus dribbling from my nose. SBG’ s hard-ass </span><span id="cant-line-4127">nerds were all around me now, running in circles, pointing, mocking theonly;  the only black man in the mix. Or were they? I took another look. </span><span id="cant-line-4128">Everyone who passed me was focused. Each in their own pain zone. They </span><span id="cant-line-4129">didn’ t even see  me. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4130">I was losing touch with reality in small doses, because my mind was folding </span><span id="cant-line-4131">over on itself, loading tremendous physical pain with dark emotional </span><span id="cant-line-4132">garbage it had dredged up from the depths of my soul. Translation: I was </span><span id="cant-line-4133">suffering on an unholy level reserved for dumb fucks who thought the laws </span><span id="cant-line-4134">of physics and physiology did not apply to them. Cocky bastards like me </span><span id="cant-line-4135">who felt like they could push the limits safely because they’d done a couple </span><span id="cant-line-4136">of Hell  Weeks. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4137">Right, well, I hadn’t done this. I hadn’ t run one hundred miles with zero </span><span id="cant-line-4138">training. Had anybody in the history of mankind even attempted something </span><span id="cant-line-4139">so fucking foolish? Could this even be done at all? Iterations of that one </span><span id="cant-line-4140">simple question slid by like a digital ticker on my brain screen. Bloody </span><span id="cant-line-4141">thought bubbles floated from my skin and  soul. </span><span id="cant-line-4142">Why? Why? Why the fuck ar e you still doing this to  yourself?! </span><span id="cant-line-4143">I hit the incline at mile sixty -nine—that seven -foot ramp, the pitch  of a </span><span id="cant-line-4144">shallow drivewa y—which would make any seasoned trail runner laugh out </span><span id="cant-line-4145">loud. It buckled  my knees and sent me reeling backward like a delivery </span><span id="cant-line-4146">truck in neutral . I staggered, reached for the ground with the tips of my </span><span id="cant-line-4147">fingers, and nearly capsized. It took ten seconds to cover the distance. Each </span><span id="cant-line-4148">one dragged out like an elastic thread, sending shockwaves of pain from my </span><span id="cant-line-4149">toes to the space behind my eyeballs. I hacked and coughed, my gut </span><span id="cant-line-4150">twisted. Collapse was imminent. Collapse is what the fuck I  deserved. </span><span id="cant-line-4151">At the seventy -mile mark I couldn’ t take another step forward. Kate had set </span><span id="cant-line-4152">up our lawn chair on the grass near the start/finish line and when I teetered </span><span id="cant-line-4153">toward her I saw her in triplicate , six hands groping toward me, guiding me </span><span id="cant-line-4154">into that folding chair . I was dizzy and dehydrated, starved of potassium </span><span id="cant-line-4155">and sodium. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4156">Kate was a nurse; I had EMT training, and went through my own mental </span><span id="cant-line-4157">checklist. I knew my blood pressure was probably dangerously low. She </span><span id="cant-line-4158">removed my shoes. My foot pain was no Shawn Dobbs illusion. My whitetube socks were  caked in blood from cracked toenails and broke n blisters. I </span><span id="cant-line-4159">asked Kate to grab some Motrin and anything she thought might be helpful </span><span id="cant-line-4160">from John Metz . And when she was gone, my body continued  to decline. </span><span id="cant-line-4161">My stomach rumbled and when I looked down I saw bloody piss leak down </span><span id="cant-line-4162">my leg. I shit myself too. Liquefied diarrhea rose in the space between my </span><span id="cant-line-4163">ass and a lawn chair that would never be quite the same again. Worse, I had </span><span id="cant-line-4164">to hide it because I knew if Kate saw how bad off I really was she would </span><span id="cant-line-4165">beg me to pull out of the  race. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4166">I’d run seventy miles in twelve hours with no training, and this was my </span><span id="cant-line-4167">reward. To my left on the lawn was another four-pack  of Myoplex. Only a </span><span id="cant-line-4168">muscle head like me would choose that thick -ass protein drink as my </span><span id="cant-line-4169">hydrating agent of choice. Next to it was half a box of Ritz crackers, the </span><span id="cant-line-4170">other half now congealing and churning in my stomach and intestinal tract </span><span id="cant-line-4171">like an orange  blob. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4172">I sat there with my head in my hands for twenty minutes. Runne rs shuffled, </span><span id="cant-line-4173">glided, or staggered past me, as I felt time tick down on my hastily </span><span id="cant-line-4174">imagined, ill-conceived  dream. Kate returned, knelt down, and helped me </span><span id="cant-line-4175">lace back up. She didn’ t know the extent of my breakdown and hadn’ t quit </span><span id="cant-line-4176">on me yet. That was something, at least, and in her hands were a welcome </span><span id="cant-line-4177">reprieve from more Myoplex and more Ritz crackers. She handed me </span><span id="cant-line-4178">Motrin, then some cookies and two peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, </span><span id="cant-line-4179">which I washed down with Gatorade. Then she helped me  stand. </span><span id="cant-line-4180">The world wobbled on its axis. Again she split into two, then three, but she </span><span id="cant-line-4181">held me there as my world stabilized and I took a single, solitary step. Cue </span><span id="cant-line-4182">the ungodly pain. I didn’ t know it yet, but my feet were slivered  with stress </span><span id="cant-line-4183">fractures. The toll of hubris is heavy on the ultra circuit, and my bill had </span><span id="cant-line-4184">come due. I took another step. And another . I winced. My eyes watered. </span><span id="cant-line-4185">Another step. She let go. I walked  on. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4186">Slowly . </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4187">Way too fucking  slow. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4188">When I stopped  at the seventy -mile mark, I was well ahead of the pace I </span><span id="cant-line-4189">needed to run one hundred miles in twenty four hours, but now I waswalking at a twenty -minute -a-mile clip, which was as fast as I could </span><span id="cant-line-4190">possibly move. Ms. Inagaki breezed by me and glanced over. There was </span><span id="cant-line-4191">pain in her eyes too, but she still looked the part of an athlete. I was a </span><span id="cant-line-4192">motherfucking zombie, giving away all the precious time I stored up, </span><span id="cant-line-4193">watching my margin for error burn to ash. Why?  Again the same boring </span><span id="cant-line-4194">question. Why?  Four hours later, at nearly 2 a.m., I hit the eighty -one-mile </span><span id="cant-line-4195">mark and Kate broke some  news. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4196">“I don’t believe you’re gonna make the time at this pace,” she said, walking </span><span id="cant-line-4197">with me, encouraging me to drink more Myoplex. She didn’ t cushion the </span><span id="cant-line-4198">blow . She was matter -of-fact about it. I stared over at her, mucus and </span><span id="cant-line-4199">Myoplex drippi ng down my chin, all the life drained from my eyes. For </span><span id="cant-line-4200">four hours, each agonizing step had demanded maximum focus and effort, </span><span id="cant-line-4201">but it wasn’t enough and unless I could find more, my philanth ropic dream </span><span id="cant-line-4202">was dead. I choked and coughed. T ook another  sip. </span><span id="cant-line-4203">“Roger that,” I said softly . I knew that she was right. My pace continued to </span><span id="cant-line-4204">slow and was only getting  worse. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4205">That’ s when I finally realized that this fight wasn’ t about Operation Red </span><span id="cant-line-4206">Wings or the families of the fallen. It was to a point, but none of that would </span><span id="cant-line-4207">help me run nineteen more miles before 10 a.m. No, this run, Badwater , my </span><span id="cant-line-4208">entire desire to push myself to the brink of destruction, was about me. It </span><span id="cant-line-4209">was about how much I was willing to suffer, how much more I could take, </span><span id="cant-line-4210">and how much I had to give. If I was gonna make it, this shit would have to </span><span id="cant-line-4211">get personal. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4212">I stared down at my legs. I could still see a trail of dried piss and blood </span><span id="cant-line-4213">stuck to my inner thigh and thought to myself, who in this entire fucked -up </span><span id="cant-line-4214">world would still be in this fight? Only you, Goggins! You haven’ t trained, </span><span id="cant-line-4215">you don’t know dick about hydration and performance—all you know is you </span><span id="cant-line-4216">refuse to  quit. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4217">Why? </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4218">It’s funny , humans tend to hatch our most challenging goals and dreams, the </span><span id="cant-line-4219">ones that demand our greatest effort yet promise absolutely nothing, when </span><span id="cant-line-4220">we are tucked into our comfort zones. I was at work when Kostman laid outhis chall enge for me. I’d just had a warm shower . I was fed and watered. I </span><span id="cant-line-4221">was comfortable. And looking back, every single time I’ve been  inspired to </span><span id="cant-line-4222">do something difficult, I was in a soft environment, because it all sounds </span><span id="cant-line-4223">doable when you’re chilling on your fucking couch, with a glass of </span><span id="cant-line-4224">lemonade or a chocolate shake in your hand. When we’re comfortable we </span><span id="cant-line-4225">can’t answer those simple questions that are bound to arise in the heat of </span><span id="cant-line-4226">battle because we don’ t even realize they’re  coming. </span><span id="cant-line-4227">But those answe rs are very important when you are no longer in your air- </span><span id="cant-line-4228">conditioned  room or under your fluffy blanket. When your body is broken </span><span id="cant-line-4229">and beaten, when you’re confro nted with agonizing pain and staring into </span><span id="cant-line-4230">the unknown, your mind will spin, and that’s when those questions become </span><span id="cant-line-4231">toxic. If you aren’t prepared in advance, if you allow your mind to remain </span><span id="cant-line-4232">undisciplined in an environmen t of intense suffering (it won’ t feel like it, </span><span id="cant-line-4233">but it is very much a choice you are making), the only answer you are likely </span><span id="cant-line-4234">to find is the one that will make it stop as fast as  possible. </span><span id="cant-line-4235">I don’ t know . </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4236">Hell Week changed everything for me. It allowed me to have the mindset to </span><span id="cant-line-4237">sign up for that twenty -four-hour race with less than a week’ s notice </span><span id="cant-line-4238">because during Hell Week you live all the emotions of life, all the highs and </span><span id="cant-line-4239">lows, in six days. In 130 hours , you earn decades of wisdom. That’ s why </span><span id="cant-line-4240">there was a schism between the twins after Marcus went throu gh BUD/S. </span><span id="cant-line-4241">He’d gained the kind of self-knowledge  that can only come from being </span><span id="cant-line-4242">broken down to nothing and finding more within. Morgan couldn’ t speak </span><span id="cant-line-4243">that language until he endured it for  himself. </span><span id="cant-line-4244">After surviving two Hell Weeks and participating in three, I was a native </span><span id="cant-line-4245">speaker . Hell Week was home. It was the fairest place I’ve ever been in this </span><span id="cant-line-4246">world. There were no timed evolutions. There was nothing graded, and </span><span id="cant-line-4247">there were no trophies. It was an all-out war of me against me, and that’s </span><span id="cant-line-4248">exactly where I found myself again when I was reduced to my absolute </span><span id="cant-line-4249">lowest on Hospitality  Point. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4250">Why?! Why ar e you still doing this to yourself, Goggins?! </span><span id="cant-line-4251">“Because you are one hard motherfucker ,” I screamed.The voices in my head were so penetrating, I had to bite back  out loud. I </span><span id="cant-line-4252">was onto somet hing. I felt an energy build immediately , as I realized that </span><span id="cant-line-4253">still being in the fight was a miracle in itself. Except it wasn’ t a miracle. </span><span id="cant-line-4254">God didn’ t come down and bless my ass. I did this! I kept going when I </span><span id="cant-line-4255">should have quit five hours ago. I am the reason I still have a chance . And I </span><span id="cant-line-4256">remembered something else too. This wasn’ t the first time I’d taken on a </span><span id="cant-line-4257">seemingly impo ssible task. I picked up my pace. I was still walking, but I </span><span id="cant-line-4258">wasn’ t sleepwalking anymore. I had life! I kept digging into my past, into </span><span id="cant-line-4259">my own imaginary Cookie  Jar. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4260">I remem bered as a kid, no matter how fucked up our life was, my mother </span><span id="cant-line-4261">always figured out a way to stock our damn cookie jar. She’d buy wafers </span><span id="cant-line-4262">and Oreos, Pepperidge Farm Milanos and Chips Ahoy!, and whenever she </span><span id="cant-line-4263">showed up with a new batch of cookies, she dumped them into one jar . With </span><span id="cant-line-4264">her perm ission we’d get to pick one or two out at a time. It was like a mini </span><span id="cant-line-4265">treasure hunt. I remember the joy of dropping my fist into that jar, </span><span id="cant-line-4266">wondering what  I’d find, and before I crammed the cookie in my mouth I </span><span id="cant-line-4267">always took the time to admire  it first, especially when we were broke in </span><span id="cant-line-4268">Brazil. I’d turn it around in my hand and say my own little praye r of thanks. </span><span id="cant-line-4269">The feeling of being that kid, locked in a moment of gratitude for a simple </span><span id="cant-line-4270">gift like a cookie, came back to me. I felt it viscerally , and I used that </span><span id="cant-line-4271">concept to stuff a new kind of Cookie Jar. Inside it were all my past </span><span id="cant-line-4272">victories. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4273">Like the time when I had to study three times as hard as anybody else </span><span id="cant-line-4274">during my senior year in high school just to graduate. That was a cookie. Or </span><span id="cant-line-4275">when I passed the ASVAB test as a senior and then again to get into </span><span id="cant-line-4276">BUD/S. Two more cookies. I remembered dropping over a hundred pounds </span><span id="cant-line-4277">in under three months, conquer ing my fear of water , graduatin g BUD/S at </span><span id="cant-line-4278">the top of my class, and being named Enlisted Honor Man in Army Ranger </span><span id="cant-line-4279">School (more on that soon). All those were cookies loaded with chocolate </span><span id="cant-line-4280">chunks. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4281">These weren’ t mere flashbacks.  I wasn’ t just floating through my memory </span><span id="cant-line-4282">files, I actually tapped into the emotional state I felt during those victories, </span><span id="cant-line-4283">and in so doing  accessed my sympathetic nervous system once  again. My </span><span id="cant-line-4284">adrenaline took over, the pain started to fade just enough, and my pacepicked up. I began swinging my arms and lengthening my stride. My </span><span id="cant-line-4285">fractured feet were still a bloody mess, full of blisters, the toenails peeling </span><span id="cant-line-4286">off almo st every toe, but I kept pounding, and soon it was me who was </span><span id="cant-line-4287">slaloming runners with pained expressions as I raced the  clock. </span><span id="cant-line-4288">From then on, the Cookie Jar became a concept I’ve employed whenever I </span><span id="cant-line-4289">need a reminder of who I am and what I’m capable of. We all have a cookie </span><span id="cant-line-4290">jar inside us, because life, being what it is, has always tested us. Even if </span><span id="cant-line-4291">you’re feeling low and beat down by life right now, I guarantee you can </span><span id="cant-line-4292">think of a time or two when you overcame odds and tasted  success. It </span><span id="cant-line-4293">doesn’ t have to be a big victory either . It can be something  small. </span><span id="cant-line-4294">I know we all want the whole victory today , but when I was teaching myself </span><span id="cant-line-4295">to read I would be happy when  I could understand every word  in a single </span><span id="cant-line-4296">paragraph. I knew I still had a long way to go to move from a third -grade </span><span id="cant-line-4297">reading level to that of a senior in high school, but even a small win like </span><span id="cant-line-4298">that was enough to keep me interested in learning and finding more within </span><span id="cant-line-4299">myself. You don’t drop one hundred pounds in less than three months </span><span id="cant-line-4300">without losing five pounds in a week first. Those first five pounds I lost </span><span id="cant-line-4301">were a small accomplishment, and it doesn’ t sound like a lot, but at the time </span><span id="cant-line-4302">it was proof that I could lose weight and that my goal, however improbable, </span><span id="cant-line-4303">was not  impossible! </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4304">The engine in a rocket ship does not fire without a small spark first. We all </span><span id="cant-line-4305">need small spark s, small accomplishments in our lives to fuel the big ones. </span><span id="cant-line-4306">Think of your small accomplishments as kindling. When you want a </span><span id="cant-line-4307">bonfire, you don’t start by lighti ng a big log. You collect some witch’ s hair </span><span id="cant-line-4308">—a small pile of hay or some dry, dead grass. You light that, and then add </span><span id="cant-line-4309">small sticks and bigger sticks before you feed your tree stump into the </span><span id="cant-line-4310">blaze. Because it’s the small sparks, which start small fires, that eventually </span><span id="cant-line-4311">build enough heat to burn the whole fucking forest  down. </span><span id="cant-line-4312">If you don’t have any big accomplishments to draw on yet, so be it. Your </span><span id="cant-line-4313">small victories are your cookies to savor , and make sure you do savor them. </span><span id="cant-line-4314">Yeah, I was hard on myself when I looked in the Accountability Mirror , but </span><span id="cant-line-4315">I also praised myself whenever I could claim a small victory , because we all </span><span id="cant-line-4316">need that, and very few of us take the time to celebrate our successes. Sure, </span><span id="cant-line-4317">in the moment, we might enjoy them, but do we ever look back on them andfeel that win again and again? Maybe that sounds narcissistic to you. But </span><span id="cant-line-4318">I’m not talking about bullshit ting about the glory days here. I’m not </span><span id="cant-line-4319">suggesting you crawl up your own ass and bore your friends with all your </span><span id="cant-line-4320">stories about what a badass you used to be. Nobody wants to hear that shit. </span><span id="cant-line-4321">I’m talking about utilizing past successes to fuel you to new and bigger </span><span id="cant-line-4322">ones. Because in the heat of battle, when shit gets real, we need to draw </span><span id="cant-line-4323">inspiration to push through our own exhaustion, depression, pain, and </span><span id="cant-line-4324">misery . We need to spark a bunch of small fires to become the </span><span id="cant-line-4325">motherfucking  inferno. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4326">But digging into the Cookie Jar when things are going south takes focus and </span><span id="cant-line-4327">determination because at first the brain doesn’ t want to go there. It wants to </span><span id="cant-line-4328">remind you that you’re suffering and that your goal is impossible. It wants </span><span id="cant-line-4329">to stop you so it can stop the pain. That night in San Diego was the most </span><span id="cant-line-4330">difficult night of my life, physically . I’d never felt so broken, and there were </span><span id="cant-line-4331">no souls to take. I wasn’ t competing for a trophy . There was no one </span><span id="cant-line-4332">standing in my way . All I had to draw on to keep myself going was  me. </span><span id="cant-line-4333">The Cookie Jar became my energy bank. Whenever the pain got to be too </span><span id="cant-line-4334">much, I dug into it and took a bite. The pain was never gone, but I only felt </span><span id="cant-line-4335">it in waves because my brain was otherwise occupied, which allowed me to </span><span id="cant-line-4336">drown out the simple questions and shrink time. Each lap became a victory </span><span id="cant-line-4337">lap, celebrating  a different cookie, another small fire. Mile eighty -one </span><span id="cant-line-4338">became eighty -two, and an hour and a half later, I was in the nineties. I’d </span><span id="cant-line-4339">run ninety fucking miles with no training! Who does that shit? An hour later </span><span id="cant-line-4340">I was at ninety -five, and after nearly  nineteen hours of running almost non- </span><span id="cant-line-4341">stop, I’d done it! I’d hit one hundred miles! Or had I? I couldn’ t remember , </span><span id="cant-line-4342">so I ran one more lap just to make  sure. </span><span id="cant-line-4343">After running 101 miles, my race finally over, I staggered to my lawn chair </span><span id="cant-line-4344">and Kate placed a camouflaged poncho liner over my body as I shivered in </span><span id="cant-line-4345">the fog. Steam poured off me. My vision was blurred. I remem ber feeling </span><span id="cant-line-4346">something warm  on my leg, looked down and saw I was pissing blood </span><span id="cant-line-4347">again. I knew what was coming next, but the port-a-potties  were about forty </span><span id="cant-line-4348">feet away, which may as well have been forty miles, or 4,000. I tried to get </span><span id="cant-line-4349">up but I was way too dizzy and collapsed back into that chair , an </span><span id="cant-line-4350">immovable object ready to accept the inevitable truth that I was about toshit myself. It was much worse this time. My entire backside and lower </span><span id="cant-line-4351">back were smeared with warm  feces. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4352">Kate knew what an emer gency looked like. She sprinted to our Toyota </span><span id="cant-line-4353">Camry and backed the car up on the grassy knoll beside me. My legs were </span><span id="cant-line-4354">stiff as fossils frozen in stone, and I leaned on her to slide into the backseat. </span><span id="cant-line-4355">She was frantic behind the whee l and wanted to take me directly to the ER, </span><span id="cant-line-4356">but I wanted to go  home. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4357">We lived on the second deck of an apartment complex in Chula Vista, and I </span><span id="cant-line-4358">leaned on her back with my arms around her neck as she led me up that </span><span id="cant-line-4359">staircase. She balanced me up against the stucco as she opened the door to </span><span id="cant-line-4360">our apartment. I took a few steps inside before blacking  out. </span><span id="cant-line-4361">I came to, on the kitchen floor , a few minutes later. My back was still </span><span id="cant-line-4362">smeared with shit, my thighs caked in blood and urine. My feet were </span><span id="cant-line-4363">blistered up and bleeding in twelve places. Seven of my ten toenails were </span><span id="cant-line-4364">dangling loose, connected only by tabs of dead skin. We had a combination </span><span id="cant-line-4365">tub and shower and she got the shower going before helping me crawl </span><span id="cant-line-4366">toward the bathroom and climb into the tub. I remember lying there, naked, </span><span id="cant-line-4367">with the shower  pouring down upon me. I shivered, felt and looked like </span><span id="cant-line-4368">death, and then I started peeing  again. But instead of blood or urine, what </span><span id="cant-line-4369">came out of me looked like thick brown  bile. </span><span id="cant-line-4370">Petrified, Kate stepped into the hall to dial my mom. She’d been to the race </span><span id="cant-line-4371">with a friend of hers who happened to be a doctor . When he heard my </span><span id="cant-line-4372">symptoms, the doctor suggested  that I might be in kidney failur e and that I </span><span id="cant-line-4373">needed to go to the ER immediately . Kate hung up, stormed into the </span><span id="cant-line-4374">bathroom, and found me lying on my left side, in the fetal  position. </span><span id="cant-line-4375">“We need to get you to the ER now , David!” </span><span id="cant-line-4376">She kept talking , shouting, crying, trying to reach me through the haze, and </span><span id="cant-line-4377">I heard most of what she said, but I knew if we went to the hospital they’d </span><span id="cant-line-4378">give me pain killers and I didn’ t want to mask this pain. I’d just </span><span id="cant-line-4379">accomplished the most amazing feat in my entire life. It was harder than </span><span id="cant-line-4380">Hell Week, more significant to me than becoming a SEAL, and more </span><span id="cant-line-4381">challenging than my deployment to Iraq because this time I had donesomething I’m not sure anyone had ever done before. I ran 101 miles with </span><span id="cant-line-4382">zero preparation. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4383">I knew then that I’d been selling myself short. That there was a whole new </span><span id="cant-line-4384">level of performance out there to tap into. That the human body can </span><span id="cant-line-4385">withstand and accomplish a hell of a lot more than most of us think </span><span id="cant-line-4386">possible, and that it all begins and ends in the mind. This wasn’ t a theory . It </span><span id="cant-line-4387">wasn’ t somethin g I’d read in a damn book. I’d experienced it first hand on </span><span id="cant-line-4388">Hospitality  Point. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4389">This last part. This pain and suffering. This was my trophy ceremony . I’d </span><span id="cant-line-4390">earned this. This was confirmation that I’d mastered my own mind—at least </span><span id="cant-line-4391">for a little while—and that what I’d just accomplished was something </span><span id="cant-line-4392">special. As I lay there, curled up in the tub, shivering in the fetal position, </span><span id="cant-line-4393">relishing the pain, I thought of something else too. If I could run 101 miles </span><span id="cant-line-4394">with zero training, imagine what I could do with a little  preparation.CHALLENGE #6 </span><span id="cant-line-4395">Take inventory of your Cookie Jar. Crack your journal open again. Write it </span><span id="cant-line-4396">all out. Remember , this is not some breezy stroll through your personal </span><span id="cant-line-4397">trophy room. Don’ t just write down your achievement hit list. Include life </span><span id="cant-line-4398">obstacles you’ve overcome as well, like quitting smoking or overcoming </span><span id="cant-line-4399">depression or a stutter . Add in those minor tasks you failed earlier in life, </span><span id="cant-line-4400">but tried again a second or third time and ultimately succeeded at. Feel what </span><span id="cant-line-4401">it was like to overcome those struggles, those opponents, and win. Then get </span><span id="cant-line-4402">to work. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4403">Set ambitious goals before each workout and let those past victories carry </span><span id="cant-line-4404">you to new personal bests. If it’s a run or bike ride, include some time to do </span><span id="cant-line-4405">interval work and challenge yourself to beat your best mile split.

THE MOST POWERFUL WEAPON </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4424">TWENTY - SEVEN  HOURS  AFTER  SAVORING  INTENSE , GRA TIFYING  PAIN  AND  BASKING  IN </span><span id="cant-line-4425">the afterglow of my greatest achievement so far, I was back at my desk on a </span><span id="cant-line-4426">Monday morning. SBG was my commanding officer, and I had his </span><span id="cant-line-4427">permission, and every known excuse, to take a few days off. Instead, </span><span id="cant-line-4428">swollen, sore, and miserable, I pulled myself out of bed, hobbled into work, </span><span id="cant-line-4429">and later that morning called Chris  Kostman. </span><span id="cant-line-4430">I’d been looking forward to this. I imagined the sweet note of surprise in his </span><span id="cant-line-4431">voice, after hearing that I’d taken his challenge and run 101 miles in less </span><span id="cant-line-4432">than twenty -four hours. Perhaps there’d even be some overdue respect as he </span><span id="cant-line-4433">made my entry to Badwater official. Instead, my call went to voicemail. I </span><span id="cant-line-4434">left him a polite message he never returned, and two days later I dropped </span><span id="cant-line-4435">him an  email. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4436">Sir, how are you doing? I ran the one hundred miles needed to qualify in </span><span id="cant-line-4437">18 hours and 56 minutes…I would like to know now what I need to do to </span><span id="cant-line-4438">get into Badwater…so we can begin raising money for the [Special </span><span id="cant-line-4439">Operations W arrior] foundation. Thanks  again… </span><span id="cant-line-4440">His reply came in the next day , and it threw me way the fuck  off. </span><span id="cant-line-4441">Congrats on your hundred -mile finish. But did you actually stop then? </span><span id="cant-line-4442">The point of a twenty -four-hour event is to run for twenty -four hours… </span><span id="cant-line-4443">Anyway…stay tuned for the announcement that you can apply…The </span><span id="cant-line-4444">race will be July 24–26. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4445">Best regards,Chris Kostman </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4446">I couldn’ t help but take his response personally . On a Wednesday he </span><span id="cant-line-4447">suggested I run one hundred miles in twenty -four hours that Saturday . I got it </span><span id="cant-line-4448">done in less time than he requir ed, and he still wasn’ t impresse d? Kostman </span><span id="cant-line-4449">was a veteran of ultra races, so he knew that strewn behind me were a dozen </span><span id="cant-line-4450">performance barriers and pain thresholds I’d shattered. Obviou sly, none of </span><span id="cant-line-4451">that meant much to  him. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4452">I cooled off for a week before I wrote him back, and in the meantime looked </span><span id="cant-line-4453">into other races  to bolster my resume. There were very few available that </span><span id="cant-line-4454">late in the year. I found a fifty-miler  on Catalina, but only triple digits would </span><span id="cant-line-4455">impress a guy like Kostman. Plus, it had been a full week since the San </span><span id="cant-line-4456">Diego One Day and my body was still monumentally fucked. I hadn’ t run </span><span id="cant-line-4457">three feet since finishing mile 101. My frustration flashed with the cursor as </span><span id="cant-line-4458">I crafted my  rebuttal. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4459">Thanks for emailing me back. I see that you enjoy talking about as much </span><span id="cant-line-4460">as I do. The only reason why I’m still bugging you is because this race </span><span id="cant-line-4461">and the cause behind it is important…If you have any other qualifying </span><span id="cant-line-4462">races that you think I should do, please let me know…Thanks for letting </span><span id="cant-line-4463">me know I’m supposed to run the full twenty -four hours. Next time I’ll </span><span id="cant-line-4464">be sure to do  that. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4465">It took him another full week to respond, and he didn’ t offer a hell of a lot </span><span id="cant-line-4466">more hope, but at least he salted it with  sarcasm. </span><span id="cant-line-4467">Hi David, </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4468">If you can do some more ultras between now and Jan 3–24, the </span><span id="cant-line-4469">application period, great. If not, submit the best possible application </span><span id="cant-line-4470">during the Jan 3–24 window and cross your  fingers. </span><span id="cant-line-4471">Thanks for your  enthusiasm, </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4472">Chris </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4473">At this point I was starting to like Chris Kostman a lot better than my </span><span id="cant-line-4474">chances of getting into Badwater . What I didn’ t know , becau se he nevermentioned it, is that Kostman was one of five people on the Badwater </span><span id="cant-line-4475">admissions committee, which reviews upwards of 1,000 applica tions a year. </span><span id="cant-line-4476">Each judge scores every application, and based on their cumulative scores, </span><span id="cant-line-4477">the top ninety applicants get in on merit. From the sounds of it, my resume </span><span id="cant-line-4478">was thin and wouldn’ t crack the top ninety . On the other hand, Kostman held </span><span id="cant-line-4479">ten wild cards in his back pocket. He could have already guaranteed me a </span><span id="cant-line-4480">spot, but for some reason he kept pushing me. Once again I’d have to prove </span><span id="cant-line-4481">myself beyond a minimum standard to get a fair shake. To become a SEAL, </span><span id="cant-line-4482">I had to deal with three Hell Weeks, and now, if I really wanted to run </span><span id="cant-line-4483">Badwater and raise money for families in need, I was going to have to find a </span><span id="cant-line-4484">way to make my application  bulletproof. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4485">Based on a link he sent along with his reply , I found one more ultra race </span><span id="cant-line-4486">scheduled befor e the Badwater application was due. It was called the Hurt </span><span id="cant-line-4487">100, and the name did not lie. One of the toughest 100-mile trail races in the </span><span id="cant-line-4488">world, it was set in a triple canopy rainforest on the island of Oahu. To cross </span><span id="cant-line-4489">the finish line, I’d have to run up and down 24,500 vertical feet. That’ s some </span><span id="cant-line-4490">Himalayan shit. I stared at the race profile. It was all sharp spikes and deep </span><span id="cant-line-4491">dives. It looked like an arrhythm ic EKG. I couldn’ t do this race cold. There’ s </span><span id="cant-line-4492">no way I could finish it without at least some training, but by early </span><span id="cant-line-4493">December I was still in so much agony that walking up the stairs to my </span><span id="cant-line-4494">apartment was pure  torture. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4495">The following weekend I zoomed up Interstate 15 to V egas for the Las V egas </span><span id="cant-line-4496">Marathon. It wasn’ t spur of the moment. Months before I’d ever heard the </span><span id="cant-line-4497">words “San Diego One Day,” Kate, my mom, and I had circled December </span><span id="cant-line-4498">5th on our calendars. It was 2005, the first year that the Las Vegas Marathon </span><span id="cant-line-4499">started on the Strip, and we wanted to be part of that shit. Except I never </span><span id="cant-line-4500">trained for it, then the San Diego One Day happened, and by the time we got </span><span id="cant-line-4501">to Vegas I had no illusions about my fitness level. I tried to run the morning </span><span id="cant-line-4502">before we left, but I still had stress fractures in my feet, my medial tendons </span><span id="cant-line-4503">were wobbly, and even while wrapped with a special bandage I’d found that </span><span id="cant-line-4504">could stabilize my ankles, I couldn’ t last longer than a quarter mile. So I </span><span id="cant-line-4505">didn’ t plan on running as we rocked up to the Mandalay Bay Casino & </span><span id="cant-line-4506">Resort on race  day. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4507">It was a beautiful morning. Music was pumping, there were thousands of </span><span id="cant-line-4508">smiling faces in the street, the clean desert air had a chill to it, and the sunwas shining. Running conditions don’t get much better , and Kate was ready </span><span id="cant-line-4509">to go. Her goal was to break five hours, and for once, I was satisfied being a </span><span id="cant-line-4510">cheerleader . My mom had always planned on walking it, and I figured I’d </span><span id="cant-line-4511">stroll with her for as long as I could, then hail a cab to the finish line and </span><span id="cant-line-4512">cheer my ladies to the  tape. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4513">The three of us toed up with the masses as the clock struck  7 a.m., and </span><span id="cant-line-4514">someone got on the mic to begin the official count down. “Ten…nine… </span><span id="cant-line-4515">eight…” When he hit one, a horn sounded, and like Pavlov’ s dog something </span><span id="cant-line-4516">clicked inside me. I still don’t know what it was. Perhaps I underestimated </span><span id="cant-line-4517">my competitive spirit. Maybe it was because I knew Navy SEALs were </span><span id="cant-line-4518">supposed to be the hardest motherfuckers in the world. We were supposed to </span><span id="cant-line-4519">run on broken legs and fractured feet. Or so went the legend I’d bought into </span><span id="cant-line-4520">long ago. Whatever it was, something triggered and the last thing I </span><span id="cant-line-4521">remember seeing as the horn echoed down the street was shock and real </span><span id="cant-line-4522">concern on the faces of Kate and my mother as I charged down the </span><span id="cant-line-4523">boulevard and out of  sight. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4524">The pain was serious for the first quarter mile, but after that adrenaline took </span><span id="cant-line-4525">over. I hit the first mile marker at 7:10 and kept running like the asphalt was </span><span id="cant-line-4526">melting behind me. Ten kilomet ers into the race, my time was around forty - </span><span id="cant-line-4527">three  minute s. That’ s solid, but I wasn’ t focused on the clock because </span><span id="cant-line-4528">considering how I’d felt the day before, I was still in total disbelief that I’d </span><span id="cant-line-4529">actually run 6.2 miles! My body was broken. How was this happ ening? Most </span><span id="cant-line-4530">people in my condition would have both feet in soft casts, and here I was </span><span id="cant-line-4531">running a  marathon! </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4532">I got to mile thirteen, the halfway point, and saw the official clock. It read, </span><span id="cant-line-4533">“1:35:55.” I did the math and realized that I was in the hunt to qualify for the </span><span id="cant-line-4534">Boston marathon, but was right on the cusp. In order to qualif y in my age </span><span id="cant-line-4535">group, I had to finish in under 3:10:59. I laughed in disbelief and slammed a </span><span id="cant-line-4536">paper cup of Gatorade. In less than two hours the game had flipped, and I </span><span id="cant-line-4537">might never get this chance again. I’d seen so much death by then—in my </span><span id="cant-line-4538">personal life and on the battlefield—that I knew tomorrow was not </span><span id="cant-line-4539">guaranteed. Before me was an opportunity , and if you give me an </span><span id="cant-line-4540">opportunity , I will break that motherfucker  off!It wasn’ t easy. I’d surfed an adrenaline wave for the first thirteen miles, but I </span><span id="cant-line-4541">felt every inch of the second half, and at mile eighteen, I hit a wall. That’ s a </span><span id="cant-line-4542">common theme in marathon running, because mile eighteen is usually when </span><span id="cant-line-4543">a runner ’s glycogen levels run low, and I was bonking, my lungs heaving. </span><span id="cant-line-4544">My legs felt like I was running  in deep Saharan sand. I needed to stop and </span><span id="cant-line-4545">take a break, but I refused, and two hard miles later I felt rejuvenated. I </span><span id="cant-line-4546">reached the next clock at mile twenty -two. I was still in the hunt for Boston, </span><span id="cant-line-4547">though I’d fallen thirty seconds  off the pace, and to qualify , the final four </span><span id="cant-line-4548">miles would have to be my very  best. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4549">I dug deep, kicked my thighs up high, and lengthened my stride.  I was a man </span><span id="cant-line-4550">possessed as I turned the final corner and charged toward the finish line at </span><span id="cant-line-4551">the Mandalay Bay. Thousands of people had assembled on the sidewalk, </span><span id="cant-line-4552">cheering. It was all a beautiful blur to me as I sprinted  home. </span><span id="cant-line-4553">I ran my last two miles at a sub-seven -minute  pace, finished the race in just </span><span id="cant-line-4554">over 3:08, and qualified for Boston. Somewhere on the streets of Las Vegas, </span><span id="cant-line-4555">my wife and mother would deal with their own struggles and overcome them </span><span id="cant-line-4556">to finish too, and as I sat on a patch of grass, waiting for them, I </span><span id="cant-line-4557">contemplated another simple question I couldn’ t shake. It was a new one, </span><span id="cant-line-4558">and wasn’ t fear-based , pain-spiked , or self-limiting . This one felt  open. </span><span id="cant-line-4559">What am I capable  of? </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4560">SEAL training had pushed me to the brink several times, but whenever it </span><span id="cant-line-4561">beat me down I popped up to take another pounding. That experience made </span><span id="cant-line-4562">me hard, but it also left me wanting more of the same, and day-to-day Navy </span><span id="cant-line-4563">SEAL life just wasn’t like that. Then came the San Diego One Day, and now </span><span id="cant-line-4564">this. I’d finished a marathon at an elite pace (for a weekend warrior) when I </span><span id="cant-line-4565">had no business  even walking a mile. Both were incredible physical feats </span><span id="cant-line-4566">that didn’ t seem possible. But they’d  happened. </span><span id="cant-line-4567">What am I capable  of? </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4568">I couldn’ t answer that question, but as I looked around the finish line that </span><span id="cant-line-4569">day and considered what I’d accomplished, it became clear that we are all </span><span id="cant-line-4570">leaving a lot of money on the table without realizing it. We habitually settle </span><span id="cant-line-4571">for less than our best; at work,  in school, in our relationships, and on theplaying field or race course. We settle as individuals, and we teach our </span><span id="cant-line-4572">children to settle for less than their best, and all of that ripples out, merges, </span><span id="cant-line-4573">and multiplies within our communities and society as a whole. We’re not </span><span id="cant-line-4574">talking some bad weekend in Vegas, no more cash at the ATM kind of loss </span><span id="cant-line-4575">either . In that moment, the cost of missing out on so much excellence in this </span><span id="cant-line-4576">eternally fucked -up world felt incal culable to me, and it still does. I haven’ t </span><span id="cant-line-4577">stopped thinking about it  since. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4578">*** </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4579">Physically , I bounced back from  Vegas within a few days. Meaning I was </span><span id="cant-line-4580">back to my new normal: dealing  with the same serious yet tolerable pain I’d </span><span id="cant-line-4581">come home to after the San Diego One Day . The aches were still there by the </span><span id="cant-line-4582">following Saturd ay, but I was done convalescing. I needed to start training or </span><span id="cant-line-4583">I’d burn out on the trail during the Hurt 100, and there would be no </span><span id="cant-line-4584">Badwater . I’d been reading up on how to prepare for ultras and knew it was </span><span id="cant-line-4585">vital to get in some hundred -mile weeks. I only had about a month to build </span><span id="cant-line-4586">my strength and endurance before race day on January  14th. </span><span id="cant-line-4587">My feet and shins weren’ t even close to right, so I came up with a new </span><span id="cant-line-4588">method to stabilize both the bones in my feet and my tendons. I bought high </span><span id="cant-line-4589">performance inserts, cut them down to fit flush with the soles of my feet, and </span><span id="cant-line-4590">taped my ankles, heels, and lower shins with compression tape. I also slid a </span><span id="cant-line-4591">small heel wedg e into my shoes to correct my running postu re and ease </span><span id="cant-line-4592">pressure. After what I’d endure d, it took a lot of props to get me running </span><span id="cant-line-4593">(nearly) pain  free. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4594">Getting hundred -mile weeks in while  holding down a steady job isn’t easy, </span><span id="cant-line-4595">but that was no excuse. My sixteen -mile commute to work from Chula Vista </span><span id="cant-line-4596">to Coronado became my go-to run. Chula Vista had a split personality when </span><span id="cant-line-4597">I lived there. There was the nicer, newer , middle class section, where we </span><span id="cant-line-4598">lived, which was surrounded by a concrete jungle of gritty , dangerous </span><span id="cant-line-4599">streets. That’ s the part I ran through at dawn, beneath freeway overpasses, </span><span id="cant-line-4600">and alongside Home Depot shipping bays. This was not your tourist </span><span id="cant-line-4601">brochure’ s version of sunny San  Diego. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4602">I sniffed car exhaust and rotting garbage, spotted skittering rats, and dodged </span><span id="cant-line-4603">sleepless homel ess camps before reaching Imperial Beach, where I pickedup the seven -mile Silver Strand bike path. It bank ed south past Coronado’ s </span><span id="cant-line-4604">landmark hotel, the turn of the century Hotel Del Coronado, and a crop of </span><span id="cant-line-4605">luxury condo towers which overlooked the same wide strip of sand shared </span><span id="cant-line-4606">by Naval Special Warfare Command, where I spent the day jumping out of </span><span id="cant-line-4607">airplanes and shooting guns. I was living the Navy SEAL legend, trying to </span><span id="cant-line-4608">keep it  real! </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4609">I ran that sixteen -mile stretch at least three times a week. Some days I ran </span><span id="cant-line-4610">home too, and on Fridays I added a ruck run. Inside the radio pouch of my </span><span id="cant-line-4611">standard issue ruck sack, I slid two twenty -five-pound  weights and ran fully </span><span id="cant-line-4612">loaded for as many as twenty miles to build quad strength. I loved waking up </span><span id="cant-line-4613">at 5 a.m. and starting work with three hours of cardio already in the bank </span><span id="cant-line-4614">while most of my teammates hadn’t even finished their coffee. It gave me a </span><span id="cant-line-4615">mental edge, a better sense of self-awareness , and a ton of self-confidence , </span><span id="cant-line-4616">which made me a better SEAL instructor . That’ s what getting up at the ass </span><span id="cant-line-4617">crack of dawn and putting out will do for you. It makes you better in all </span><span id="cant-line-4618">facets of your  life. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4619">During my first real deal week  of training, I ran seventy -seven  miles. The </span><span id="cant-line-4620">following week, I ran 109 miles, including a twelve -mile run on Christmas </span><span id="cant-line-4621">Day. The next week I pushed it to 111.5, including a nineteen -mile run on </span><span id="cant-line-4622">New Year’s Day, and the following week I backed off to taper my legs, but </span><span id="cant-line-4623">still got 56.5 miles in. All of those were road miles, but what I had coming </span><span id="cant-line-4624">up was a trail run, and I had never run on a trail before. I’d bushwhacked a </span><span id="cant-line-4625">bunch, but I hadn’ t run distanc e on single track with a clock running. The </span><span id="cant-line-4626">Hurt 100 was a twenty -mile circuit course, and I’d heard that only a slim </span><span id="cant-line-4627">slice of those who start the race finish all five laps. This was my last chance </span><span id="cant-line-4628">to pad my Badw ater resume. I had a lot riding on a successful outcome, and </span><span id="cant-line-4629">there was so much about the race, and about ultra running, that I still didn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-4630">know .Hurt 100 W eek 3 training log </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4631">I flew into Honolulu a few days early and checked into the Halekoa, a </span><span id="cant-line-4632">military hotel where active duty and veterans stay with their families when </span><span id="cant-line-4633">they come through town. I’d studied the maps and knew the basics when it </span><span id="cant-line-4634">came to the terrain, but I hadn’ t seen it up close, so I drove over to the </span><span id="cant-line-4635">Hawaii Nature Center the day before the race and stared into the velvety , </span><span id="cant-line-4636">jade mountains. All I could see was a steep cut of red earth disap pearing into </span><span id="cant-line-4637">the dense green. I walked up the trail for a half mile, but there was only so </span><span id="cant-line-4638">far I could hike. I was tapering, and the first mile was straight uphill. </span><span id="cant-line-4639">Everything beyond that would have to remain a mystery for a little  longer .There were just three aid stations on the twenty -mile course, and most </span><span id="cant-line-4640">athletes were self-reliant  and dialed in their own nutritional regimen. I was </span><span id="cant-line-4641">still a neophyte, and had no clue what I needed when it came to fuel. I met a </span><span id="cant-line-4642">woman at the hotel at 5:30 a.m. on race day morning as we were about to </span><span id="cant-line-4643">leave. She knew I was a rookie and asked what I’d brought with me to keep </span><span id="cant-line-4644">myself going. I showed her my meager stash of flavored energy gels, and my </span><span id="cant-line-4645">CamelBak. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4646">“You didn’ t bring salt pills?” she asked, shocked. I shrugged. I didn’ t know </span><span id="cant-line-4647">what the fuck a salt pill was. She poured a hundred of them into my palm. </span><span id="cant-line-4648">“Take two of these, every hour . They’ll keep you from  cramping.” </span><span id="cant-line-4649">“Roger that.” She smiled and shook her head like she could see my fucked - </span><span id="cant-line-4650">up future. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4651">I had a strong start and felt great, but not long after the race began I knew I </span><span id="cant-line-4652">was facing a monster course. I’m not talking about the grade and elevation </span><span id="cant-line-4653">variance. I expected that. It was all the rocks and roots that took me by </span><span id="cant-line-4654">surprise. I was lucky that it hadn’ t rained in a couple of days because all I </span><span id="cant-line-4655">had to wear were my standard running shoes, which had precious little tread. </span><span id="cant-line-4656">Then my CamelBak broke at mile  six. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4657">I shook it off and kept hammering, but without a water source, I’d have to </span><span id="cant-line-4658">rely on the aid stations to hydrate, and they were spaced miles apart. I didn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-4659">even have my support crew (of one) yet. Kate was chilling on the beach and </span><span id="cant-line-4660">didn’ t plan on showing up until later in the race, which was was my own </span><span id="cant-line-4661">fault. I enticed her to come along by promising a vacation, and early that </span><span id="cant-line-4662">morning I insisted she enjoy Hawaii and leave the suffering to me. With or </span><span id="cant-line-4663">without a CamelBak, my mind set was to make it from aid station to aid </span><span id="cant-line-4664">station and see what  happens. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4665">Before the race started I heard people talking about Karl Meltzer . I’d seen </span><span id="cant-line-4666">him stretching out and warming up. His nickname was the Speedgoat, and he </span><span id="cant-line-4667">was trying to become the first person ever to complete the race in less than </span><span id="cant-line-4668">twenty -four hours. For the rest of us there was a thirty -six hour time limit. </span><span id="cant-line-4669">My first lap took four and a half hours, and I felt okay afterwards, which was </span><span id="cant-line-4670">to be expected considering all the long days I’d done in prepa ration, but I </span><span id="cant-line-4671">was also concerned because each lap demanded an ascent and descent ofaround 5,000 vertical feet, and the amount of focus it took to pay attention to </span><span id="cant-line-4672">every step so I didn’ t turn an ankle amped up my mental fatigu e. Each time </span><span id="cant-line-4673">my medial tendon twinged it felt like a raw nerve exposed to the wind, and I </span><span id="cant-line-4674">knew one stumble could fold my wobbly ankle and end my race. I felt that </span><span id="cant-line-4675">pressure every single moment, and as a result, I burned more calories than </span><span id="cant-line-4676">expected. Which  was a problem because I had very little fuel, and without a </span><span id="cant-line-4677">water source, I couldn’ t hydrate  effectively . </span><span id="cant-line-4678">Between laps, I guzzled water , and with my belly sloshing started my second </span><span id="cant-line-4679">loop, with a slow jog up that one-mile-long, 800-foot climb into the </span><span id="cant-line-4680">mountains (basically straight uphill). That’ s when it started to rain. Our red </span><span id="cant-line-4681">earth trail becam e mud within minutes. The soles of my shoes  were coated </span><span id="cant-line-4682">with it and slick  as skis. I sloshed through shin deep puddles, skidded down </span><span id="cant-line-4683">descents, and slipped on ascents. It was a full-body  sport. But at least there </span><span id="cant-line-4684">was water . Whenever I was dry I tipped my head back, opened wide, and </span><span id="cant-line-4685">tasted the rain, which filtered through a triple canopy jungle that smelled of </span><span id="cant-line-4686">leaf rot and shit. The feral funk of fertility invaded my nostrils, and all I </span><span id="cant-line-4687">could think of was the fact that I had to run four more fucking  laps! </span><span id="cant-line-4688">At mile thirty , my body reported some positive news. Or maybe it was the </span><span id="cant-line-4689">physical manifestation of a backhanded compliment? The tendon pain in my </span><span id="cant-line-4690">ankles had vanished…because my feet had swollen enough to stabilize those </span><span id="cant-line-4691">tendons. Was this a good thing long-term? Probably not, but you take what </span><span id="cant-line-4692">you can get on the ultra circuit, where you have to roll with whatever gets </span><span id="cant-line-4693">you from  mile to mile. Meanwhile, my quads and calves ached like they’d </span><span id="cant-line-4694">been thumped with a sledgeham mer. Yeah, I had done a lot of running, but </span><span id="cant-line-4695">most of it—incl uding my ruck runs—on pancake flat terrain in San Diego, </span><span id="cant-line-4696">not on slick jungle  trails. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4697">Kate was waiting for me by the time I completed my second lap, and after </span><span id="cant-line-4698">spending a relaxing morning on Waikiki beach, she watched in horror as I </span><span id="cant-line-4699">materialized from the mist like a zombie from the Walking Dead. I sat and </span><span id="cant-line-4700">guzzled as much water as I could. By then, word had gotten out that it was </span><span id="cant-line-4701">my first trail  race. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4702">Have you ever had a very public fuck-up, or were in the midst of a shitty </span><span id="cant-line-4703">day/week/month/year , yet people around you felt obliged to comment on the </span><span id="cant-line-4704">source of your humiliation? Maybe they reminded you of all the ways youcould have ensured a very different outcome? Now imagine consuming that </span><span id="cant-line-4705">negativity , but having to run sixty more miles in the sweaty , jungle rain on </span><span id="cant-line-4706">top of it. Does that sound like fun? Yeah, I was the talk of the race. Well, me </span><span id="cant-line-4707">and Karl Meltzer . Nobody could believe he was gunning for a sub-twenty - </span><span id="cant-line-4708">four-hour experie nce, and it was equally baffling that I showed up to one of </span><span id="cant-line-4709">the most  treacherous trail races on the planet, undersupplied and unprepared, </span><span id="cant-line-4710">with no trail races under my belt. By the time I began my third loop there </span><span id="cant-line-4711">were only forty athletes, out of nearly a hundred, left in the race, and I </span><span id="cant-line-4712">started running with a guy named Luis Escobar . For the tenth time I heard </span><span id="cant-line-4713">the following  words: </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4714">“So it’s your first trail race?” he asked. I nodded. “You really picked the </span><span id="cant-line-4715">wrong…” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4716">“I know ,” I said. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4717">“It’s just such a  technical…” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4718">“Right. I’m a fucking idiot. I’ve heard that a lot  today .” </span><span id="cant-line-4719">“That’ s okay ,” he said, “we’re all of bunch of idiots out here, man.” He </span><span id="cant-line-4720">handed me a water bottle. He was carrying three of them. “Take this. I heard </span><span id="cant-line-4721">about your  CamelBak.” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4722">This being my second race, I was starting to understand the rhythm of ultra. </span><span id="cant-line-4723">It’s a constant dance between competition and camaraderie, which reminded </span><span id="cant-line-4724">me of BUD/S. Luis and I were both racing the clock and each other , but we </span><span id="cant-line-4725">wanted one another to make it. We were in it alone, together , and he was </span><span id="cant-line-4726">right. W e were a couple of fucking  idiots. </span><span id="cant-line-4727">Darkness descended and left us with a pitch -black  jungle night. Running side </span><span id="cant-line-4728">by side, the glow of our headlam ps merged and shed a wider light, but once </span><span id="cant-line-4729">we separated all I could see was a yellow ball bouncing on the trail ahead of </span><span id="cant-line-4730">me. Countless trip wires— shin-high logs, slick roots, lichen -wrapped  rocks </span><span id="cant-line-4731">—remained out of sight. I slipped, stumbled, fell, and cursed. Jungle noises </span><span id="cant-line-4732">were everywhere. It wasn’ t just the insect world that had my attention. In </span><span id="cant-line-4733">Hawaii, on all the islands, bow hunting for wild pig in the mountains is a </span><span id="cant-line-4734">major pastime, and master hunters often leave their pit bulls chained up inthe jungle to develop a nose for swine. I heard every one of those hungry </span><span id="cant-line-4735">bulls snapping and growling, and I heard some pigs squealing too. I smelled </span><span id="cant-line-4736">their fear and rage, their piss and shit, their sour fucking  breath. </span><span id="cant-line-4737">With each nearb y bark or yelp, my heart skipped and I jumped on terrain so </span><span id="cant-line-4738">slick that injury was a real possi bility . One wrong step could roll my ass out </span><span id="cant-line-4739">of the race and out of contention for Badwater . I could picture Kostman </span><span id="cant-line-4740">hearing the news and nodding like he figured that shit would happen all </span><span id="cant-line-4741">along. I know him pretty well now, and he was never out to get me, but </span><span id="cant-line-4742">that’s how my mind worked back then. And in the steep, dark mountains of </span><span id="cant-line-4743">Oahu, my exhau stion magnified  my stress. I felt close to my absolute limit, </span><span id="cant-line-4744">but still had more than forty miles to  go! </span><span id="cant-line-4745">On the backside of the course, after a long technical descent into the dark, </span><span id="cant-line-4746">dank forest I saw another headl amp circling ahead of me in a cutout on the </span><span id="cant-line-4747">trail. The runner was moving in curlicues and when I caught up to him I </span><span id="cant-line-4748">could see it was a Hungarian runner I’d met in San Diego named Akos </span><span id="cant-line-4749">Konya. He was one of the best runners in the field on Hospitality Point, </span><span id="cant-line-4750">where he covered 134 miles in twenty -four hours. I liked Akos and had mad </span><span id="cant-line-4751">respect for him. I stopped and watched him move in conjoining circles, </span><span id="cant-line-4752">covering the same terrain over and over again. Was he looking for </span><span id="cant-line-4753">something? W as he  hallucinating? </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4754">“Akos,” I asked, “you okay , man? Do you need some  help?” </span><span id="cant-line-4755">“David, no! I…no, I’m fine,”  he said. His eyes were full-moon  flying </span><span id="cant-line-4756">saucers. He was in delirium, but I was barely hanging on myself and wasn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-4757">sure what I could do for him other than tell staff at the next aid station he </span><span id="cant-line-4758">was wandering in a daze. Like I said, there’ s camaraderie  and there’ s </span><span id="cant-line-4759">competition on the ultra circuit , and since he wasn’ t in obvious pain and </span><span id="cant-line-4760">refused my help, I had to go into barbarian mode. With two full laps to go, I </span><span id="cant-line-4761">had no choice but to keep  moving. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4762">I staggered back to the start line and slumped into my chair , dazed. It was </span><span id="cant-line-4763">dark as space, the temperature was dropping, and rain was still pissing down. </span><span id="cant-line-4764">I was at the very edge of my capability , and wasn’ t sure that I could take one </span><span id="cant-line-4765">more step. I felt like I’d drained 99 percent from my tank, at least. My gaslight was on, my engine shuddering, yet I knew I had to find more if I was </span><span id="cant-line-4766">going to finish this race and get myself into  Badwater . </span><span id="cant-line-4767">But how do you push yourself when pain is all you feel with every step? </span><span id="cant-line-4768">When agony is the feedback loop that permeates each cell in your body , </span><span id="cant-line-4769">begging you to stop? That’ s tricky because the threshold for suffering is </span><span id="cant-line-4770">different for everybody . What’ s universal is the impulse to succumb. To feel </span><span id="cant-line-4771">like you’ve given everything you can, and that you are justified in leaving a </span><span id="cant-line-4772">job undone. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4773">By now, I’m sure you can tell that it doesn’ t take much for me to become </span><span id="cant-line-4774">obsessed. Some  criticize my level of passion, but I’m not down with the </span><span id="cant-line-4775">prevailing menta lities that tend to dominate American society these days; the </span><span id="cant-line-4776">ones that tell us to go with the flow or invite us to learn how to get more </span><span id="cant-line-4777">with less effort. Fuck that short cut bullshit. The reason I embr ace my own </span><span id="cant-line-4778">obsessions and demand and desire more of myself is because I’ve learned </span><span id="cant-line-4779">that it’s only when I push beyond pain and suffering, past my perceived </span><span id="cant-line-4780">limitations, that I’m capable of accomplishing more, physically and mentally </span><span id="cant-line-4781">—in endurance races but also in life as a  whole. </span><span id="cant-line-4782">And I believe the same is true for  you. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4783">The human body is like a stock car. We may look different on the outside, </span><span id="cant-line-4784">but unde r the hood we all have huge reservoirs of potential and a governor </span><span id="cant-line-4785">impeding us from reaching our maximum velocity . In a car, the governor </span><span id="cant-line-4786">limits the flow of fuel and air so it doesn’ t burn too hot, which places a </span><span id="cant-line-4787">ceiling on performance. It’s a hardware issue; the governor can easily be </span><span id="cant-line-4788">removed, and if you disable yours, watch your car rocket beyond 130  mph. </span><span id="cant-line-4789">It’s a subtler process in the human  animal. </span><span id="cant-line-4790">Our governor is buried deep in our minds, intertwined with our very identity . </span><span id="cant-line-4791">It knows what and who we love and hate; it’s read our whole life story and </span><span id="cant-line-4792">forms the way we see ourselves and how we’d like to be seen. It’s the </span><span id="cant-line-4793">software that delivers persona lized feedback—in the form of pain and </span><span id="cant-line-4794">exhaustion, but also fear and insecurity , and it uses all of that to encourage </span><span id="cant-line-4795">us to stop before  we risk it all. But, here’ s the thing, it doesn’ t have absolutecontrol. Unlike the governor in an engine, ours can’t stop us unless we buy </span><span id="cant-line-4796">into its bullshit and agree to  quit. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4797">Sadly , most of us give up when we’ve only given around 40 percent of our </span><span id="cant-line-4798">maximum effort. Even when we feel like we’ve reached our absolute limit, </span><span id="cant-line-4799">we still have 60 percent more to give! That’ s the governor in action! Once </span><span id="cant-line-4800">you know that to be true, it’s simply a matter of stretching your pain </span><span id="cant-line-4801">tolerance, letting  go of your identity and all your self-limiting  stories, so you </span><span id="cant-line-4802">can get to 60 percent, then 80 percent and beyond without giving up. I call </span><span id="cant-line-4803">this The 40% Rule, and the reason it’s so powerful is that if you follow it, </span><span id="cant-line-4804">you will unlock  your mind to new levels of performance and excellence in </span><span id="cant-line-4805">sports and in life, and your rewards will run far deeper than mere material </span><span id="cant-line-4806">success. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4807">The 40% Rule can be applied to everything we do. Because in life almost </span><span id="cant-line-4808">nothing will turn out exactly as we hope. There are always challenges, and </span><span id="cant-line-4809">whether we are at work or schoo l, or feeling tested within our most intimate </span><span id="cant-line-4810">or impo rtant relationships, we will all be tempted to walk  away from </span><span id="cant-line-4811">commitments, give up on our goals and dreams, and sell our own happiness </span><span id="cant-line-4812">short at some point. Because we will feel empty , like we have no more to </span><span id="cant-line-4813">give, when we haven’ t tapped even half of the treasure buried deep in our </span><span id="cant-line-4814">minds, hearts, and  souls. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4815">I know how it feels to be approa ching an energetic dead end. I’ve been there </span><span id="cant-line-4816">too many times to count. I unde rstand the temptation to sell short, but I also </span><span id="cant-line-4817">know that impulse is driven by your mind’ s desire for comfort, and it’s not </span><span id="cant-line-4818">telling you the truth. It’s your identity trying to find sanctuary , not help you </span><span id="cant-line-4819">grow . It’s looking for status quo, not reaching for greatness or seeking </span><span id="cant-line-4820">wholeness. But the software update that you need to shut your governor </span><span id="cant-line-4821">down is no supersonic downloa d. It takes twenty years to gain twenty years </span><span id="cant-line-4822">of experience, and the only way to move beyond your 40 percent is to </span><span id="cant-line-4823">callous your mind, day after day . Which means you’ll have to chase pain like </span><span id="cant-line-4824">it’s your damn  job! </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4825">Imagine you’re a boxer , and on your first day in the ring you take one on </span><span id="cant-line-4826">your chin. It’s gonna hurt like fucking hell, but at year ten of being a boxer , </span><span id="cant-line-4827">you won’ t be stopped by one punch. You’ll be able to absorb twelve rounds </span><span id="cant-line-4828">of gettin g beat the fuck down and come back the very next day and fightagain. It’s not that the punch has lost power . Your opponents will be even </span><span id="cant-line-4829">stronger . The change has happened within your brain. You’ve calloused your </span><span id="cant-line-4830">mind. Over a period of time, your tolerance for mental and physical </span><span id="cant-line-4831">suffering will have expanded because your software will have learned that </span><span id="cant-line-4832">you can take a hell of a lot more than one punch, and if you stay with any </span><span id="cant-line-4833">task that is trying to beat you down, you will reap  rewards. </span><span id="cant-line-4834">Not a fighter? Say you like to run but have a broken pinky toe. I’ll bet if you </span><span id="cant-line-4835">continue runnin g on it, pretty soon you’ll be able to run on broken legs. </span><span id="cant-line-4836">Sounds impossib le, right? I know it’s true, because I’ve run on broken legs, </span><span id="cant-line-4837">and that knowle dge helped me endure all manner of agonies on the ultra </span><span id="cant-line-4838">circuit, which has revealed a clear spring of self confidence that I drink from </span><span id="cant-line-4839">whenever my tank is  dry. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4840">But nobody taps their reserve 60 percent right away or all at once. The first </span><span id="cant-line-4841">step is to remember that your initial blast of pain and fatigue is your </span><span id="cant-line-4842">governor talking. Once you do that, you are in control of the dialogue in </span><span id="cant-line-4843">your mind, and you can remind  yourself that you are not as drained as you </span><span id="cant-line-4844">think. That you haven’ t given it your all. Not even close. Buying into that </span><span id="cant-line-4845">will keep you in the fight, and that’s worth an extra 5 percen t. Of course, </span><span id="cant-line-4846">that’s easier read than  done. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4847">It wasn’t easy to begin the fourth lap of the Hurt 100 because I knew how </span><span id="cant-line-4848">much it would hurt, and when you are feeling dead and buried , dehydrated, </span><span id="cant-line-4849">wrung out, and torn the fuck up at 40 percent, finding that extra 60 percent </span><span id="cant-line-4850">feels impossible. I didn’ t want my suffering to continue. Nobody does! </span><span id="cant-line-4851">That’ s why the line “fatigue makes cowards of us all” is true as  shit. </span><span id="cant-line-4852">Mind you, I didn’ t know anythi ng about The 40% Rule that day. The Hurt </span><span id="cant-line-4853">100 is when I first started to contemplate it, but I had hit the wall many times </span><span id="cant-line-4854">before, and I had learned to stay present and open minded enough to </span><span id="cant-line-4855">recalibrate my goals even at my lowest. I knew that staying in the fight is </span><span id="cant-line-4856">always the hardest, and most rewarding, first  step. </span><span id="cant-line-4857">Of course, it’s easy to be open minded when you leave yoga class and are </span><span id="cant-line-4858">taking a stroll by the beach, but when you’re suffering, keeping an open </span><span id="cant-line-4859">mind is hard work. The same is true if you are facing a daunting challenge </span><span id="cant-line-4860">on the job or at school. Maybe you are tackling a hundred -question  test andknow that you’v e bricked the first fifty. At that point, it’s extremely difficult </span><span id="cant-line-4861">to maintain the necessary discip line to force yourself to keep taking the test </span><span id="cant-line-4862">seriously . It’s also imperative that you find it because in every failure there is </span><span id="cant-line-4863">something to be gained, even if it’s only practice for the next test you’ll have </span><span id="cant-line-4864">to take. Because that next test is coming. That’ s a guarantee. </span><span id="cant-line-4865">I didn’t start my fourth lap with any sort of conviction. I was in wait-and-see </span><span id="cant-line-4866">mode, and halfway up that first climb I became so dizzy I had to sit under a </span><span id="cant-line-4867">tree for a while. T wo runners passed me, one at a time. They checked in but I </span><span id="cant-line-4868">waved them on. T old them I was just  fine. </span><span id="cant-line-4869">Yeah, I was doing great. I was a regular Akos  Konya. </span><span id="cant-line-4870">From my vantage point I could see the crest of the hill above and encouraged </span><span id="cant-line-4871">myself to walk at least that far. If I still wanted to quit after that, I told </span><span id="cant-line-4872">myself that I would be willing to sign off, and that there is no shame in not </span><span id="cant-line-4873">finishing the Hurt 100. I said that to myself again and again because that’s </span><span id="cant-line-4874">how our governor works. It massages your ego even as it stops you short of </span><span id="cant-line-4875">your goals. But once I got to the top of the climb, the higher ground gave me </span><span id="cant-line-4876">a new perspective and I saw another place off in the distance and decided to </span><span id="cant-line-4877">cover that small stretch of mud, rock, and root too—you know, before </span><span id="cant-line-4878">quitting for  good. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4879">Once I got there I was staring down a long descent and even  though the </span><span id="cant-line-4880">footing was troubling, it still looked much easier than going uphill. Without </span><span id="cant-line-4881">realizing it, I’d gotten to a point where I was able to strategize. On the first </span><span id="cant-line-4882">climb, I was so dizzy and weak  I was swept into a moment of fuck, which </span><span id="cant-line-4883">clogged my brain. There was no room for strategy . I just wanted to quit, but </span><span id="cant-line-4884">by moving a little bit further I’d reset my brain. I’d calmed down and </span><span id="cant-line-4885">realized I could chunk the race down to size, and staying in the game like </span><span id="cant-line-4886">that gave me hope, and hope is  addictive. </span><span id="cant-line-4887">I chunked the race out that way, collecting 5 percent chips, unlocking more </span><span id="cant-line-4888">energy, then burning it up as time bled into the wee hours. I became so tired </span><span id="cant-line-4889">I damn near fell asleep on my feet, and that’s dangerous on a trail with so </span><span id="cant-line-4890">many switchbac ks and drop offs. Any runner could have easily  sleepwalked </span><span id="cant-line-4891">into oblivion. The one thing keeping me awake was the piss-poor trail </span><span id="cant-line-4892">condition. I fell on my ass dozen s of times. My street shoes were out of theirelement. It felt like I was running on ice, and the inevitable fall was always </span><span id="cant-line-4893">jarring, but at least it woke me  up. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4894">By running a little while, then walking a stretch, I was able to forge ahead to </span><span id="cant-line-4895">mile seventy -seven , the toughest descent of them all, which is when I saw </span><span id="cant-line-4896">Karl Meltzer , the Speedgoat, crest the hill behind me. He wore a lamp on his </span><span id="cant-line-4897">head and anothe r on his wrist, and a hip pack with two big water bottles. </span><span id="cant-line-4898">Silhouetted in pink dawn light he charged down slope, navigating a section </span><span id="cant-line-4899">that had me stumbling and groping for tree branches to stay upright. He was </span><span id="cant-line-4900">about to lap me, three miles from  the finish line, on pace for a course record, </span><span id="cant-line-4901">twenty -two hours and sixte en minutes, but what I remember most is how </span><span id="cant-line-4902">graceful he looked running at an incredible 6:30 per mile pace. He was </span><span id="cant-line-4903">levitating over the mud, riding a whole dif ferent Zen. His feet barely touched </span><span id="cant-line-4904">the ground, and it was a beautiful fucking sight. The Speedgoat was the </span><span id="cant-line-4905">living, breathing answer to the question that colonized my mind after the Las </span><span id="cant-line-4906">Vegas marathon. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4907">What am I capable  of? </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4908">Watching that bad man glide across the most challenging terrain made me </span><span id="cant-line-4909">realize that there is a whole other level of athlete out there in the world, and </span><span id="cant-line-4910">that some of that was inside me too. In fact, it’s in all of us. I’m not saying </span><span id="cant-line-4911">that genetics don’t play a role in athletic performance, or that everyone has </span><span id="cant-line-4912">an undiscovered  ability to run a four-minute  mile, dunk like LeBron James, </span><span id="cant-line-4913">shoot like Steph Curry , or run the Hurt 100 in twenty -two hours. We don’t </span><span id="cant-line-4914">all have the same floor or ceiling, but we each have a lot more in us than we </span><span id="cant-line-4915">know , and when it comes to endurance sports like ultra runnin g, everyone </span><span id="cant-line-4916">can achieve feats they once thought impossible. In order to do that we must </span><span id="cant-line-4917">change our mind s, be willing to scrap our identity , and make the extra effort </span><span id="cant-line-4918">to always find more in order to become  more. </span><span id="cant-line-4919">We must remove our  governor . </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4920">That day on the Hurt 100 circui t, after seeing Meltzer run like a superhero, I </span><span id="cant-line-4921">finished my fourth lap in all kinds of pain and took time to watch him </span><span id="cant-line-4922">celebrate, surrou nded by his team. He’d just achieved something nobody had </span><span id="cant-line-4923">ever done before and here I was with another full lap to go. My legs were </span><span id="cant-line-4924">rubber , my feet swollen. I did not want to go on, but I also knew  that was mypain talking. My true potential was still undetermined. Looking back, I’d say </span><span id="cant-line-4925">I’d given 60 percent, which meant my tank was just shy of half-full. </span><span id="cant-line-4926">I’d like to sit here and tell you I went all-out and drained that fucker on lap </span><span id="cant-line-4927">five, but I was still a mere tourist on planet ultra. I wasn’ t the master of my </span><span id="cant-line-4928">mind. I was in the laboratory , still in discovery mode, and I walked every </span><span id="cant-line-4929">single step of my fifth and final lap. It took me eight hours, but the rain had </span><span id="cant-line-4930">stopped, the tropical glow of the warm Hawaiian sun felt phenomenal, and I </span><span id="cant-line-4931">got the job done. I finished Hurt 100 in thirty -three  hours and twenty -three </span><span id="cant-line-4932">minutes, just shy of the thirty -six-hour cut off, good enough for ninth place. </span><span id="cant-line-4933">Only twenty -three  athletes finished the entire race, and I was one of  them. </span><span id="cant-line-4934">I was so thrashed afterward, two people carried me to the car, and Kate had </span><span id="cant-line-4935">to spin me up to my room in a damn wheelchair . When we got there, we had </span><span id="cant-line-4936">more work to do. I wanted to get my Badwater application done ASAP , so </span><span id="cant-line-4937">without so much as a cat nap, we polished that shit  up. </span><span id="cant-line-4938">Within a matter of days, Kostman emailed me to let me know that I had been </span><span id="cant-line-4939">accepted into Badwater . It was a great feeling. It also meant that for the next </span><span id="cant-line-4940">six months I had two full-time jobs. I was a Navy SEAL in full preparation </span><span id="cant-line-4941">mode for Badw ater. This time I would get strategic and specific because I </span><span id="cant-line-4942">knew that in order to unleash my best performance—if I wanted  to blow past </span><span id="cant-line-4943">40 percent, drain my tank, and tap my full potential—I had to first give </span><span id="cant-line-4944">myself an  opportunity . </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4945">I didn’ t research or prepare for the Hurt 100 well enough. I hadn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-4946">anticipated the rough terrain, I had no support crew for the first part of the </span><span id="cant-line-4947">race, and I had no back -up water source. I didn’ t bring two headlamps, </span><span id="cant-line-4948">which would have helped during the long, bleak night, and though I sure felt </span><span id="cant-line-4949">like I had given everything I had, I never even had a chance to access my </span><span id="cant-line-4950">true 100  percent. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4951">Badwater was going to be different. I researched day and night. I studied the </span><span id="cant-line-4952">course, noted temperature and elevation variances, and charted them out. I </span><span id="cant-line-4953">wasn’ t just interested in the air temperature. I drilled down deeper so I knew </span><span id="cant-line-4954">how hot the pavement would be on the hottest Death Valley day ever. I </span><span id="cant-line-4955">Googled videos of the race and watched them for hours. I read blogs fromrunners who completed it, noted their pitfalls and training techniques. I </span><span id="cant-line-4956">drove north to Death V alley and explored the entire  course. </span><span id="cant-line-4957">Seeing the terrain up close revealed its brutality . The first forty -two miles </span><span id="cant-line-4958">were dead flat—a run through God’ s blast furnace cranked up high. That </span><span id="cant-line-4959">would be my best opportunity to make great time, but to survive it, I’d need </span><span id="cant-line-4960">two crew  vehicl es to leap frog one another and set up cooling stations every </span><span id="cant-line-4961">third of a mile. The thought of it thrilled me, but then again, I wasn’ t living it </span><span id="cant-line-4962">yet. I was listen ing to music, windows down on a spring day in a blooming </span><span id="cant-line-4963">desert. I was comfortable as hell! It was all still a fucked -up fantasy! </span><span id="cant-line-4964">I marked off the best spots to set up my cooling stations. I noted wherever </span><span id="cant-line-4965">the shoulder was wide, and where stopping would have to be avoided. I also </span><span id="cant-line-4966">took note of gas stations and other places to fill up on water and buy ice. </span><span id="cant-line-4967">There weren’ t many of them, but they were all mapped. After  running the </span><span id="cant-line-4968">desert gauntlet I’d earn some relief from the heat and pay for it with altitude. </span><span id="cant-line-4969">The next stage of the race was an eighteen -mile climb to Towne Pass at </span><span id="cant-line-4970">4,800 feet. The sun would be setting by then and after driving that section, I </span><span id="cant-line-4971">pulled over , closed my eyes, and visualized it  all. </span><span id="cant-line-4972">Research is one part of prepara tion; visualization is another . Following that </span><span id="cant-line-4973">Towne Pass climb, I would face a bone -crushing , nine-mile descent. I could </span><span id="cant-line-4974">see it unfurl from the top of the pass. One thing I learned from the Hurt 100 </span><span id="cant-line-4975">is that running downhill fucks you up bad, and this time I’d be doing it on </span><span id="cant-line-4976">asphalt. I closed my eyes, opene d my mind, and tried to feel the pain in my </span><span id="cant-line-4977">quads and calves, knees and shins. I knew my quads would bear the brunt of </span><span id="cant-line-4978">that descent, so I made a note to add muscle. My thighs woul d need to be </span><span id="cant-line-4979">plated in  steel. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-4980">The eighteen -mile climb up Darwin Pass from mile seventy -two would be </span><span id="cant-line-4981">pure hell. I’d have to run-walk  that section, but the sun would be down, I’d </span><span id="cant-line-4982">welcome the chill in Lone Pine, and from there I could make up some time </span><span id="cant-line-4983">because that’s where the road flattened out again before the final thirteen - </span><span id="cant-line-4984">mile climb up Whitney Portal Road, to the finish line at 8,374  feet. </span><span id="cant-line-4985">Then again, it’ s easy to write “make up time” in your notepad, and another to </span><span id="cant-line-4986">execute it when you get there in real life, but at least I had notes. Together </span><span id="cant-line-4987">with my annota ted maps, they made up my Badwater file, which I studiedlike I was preparing for another  ASVAB test. I sat at my kitche n table, read </span><span id="cant-line-4988">and re-read them, and visualized each mile the best I could, but I also knew </span><span id="cant-line-4989">that my body still hadn’ t recovered from Hawaii, which hamper ed the other , </span><span id="cant-line-4990">even more important aspect of my Badwater prep: physical  training. </span><span id="cant-line-4991">I was in dire need of PT, but my tendons still hurt so bad I couldn’ t run for </span><span id="cant-line-4992">months. Pages were flying off the calendar . I needed to get harder and </span><span id="cant-line-4993">become the strongest runner possible, and the fact that I couldn’ t train like </span><span id="cant-line-4994">I’d hope d sappe d my confidence. Plus, word had gotten out at work about </span><span id="cant-line-4995">what I was getting myself into, and while I had some support from fellow </span><span id="cant-line-4996">SEALs, I got my share of negativity too, especially when they found out I </span><span id="cant-line-4997">still couldn’ t run. But that was nothing new. Who hasn’ t dreamed up a </span><span id="cant-line-4998">possibility for themselves only to have friends, colleagues, or family shit all </span><span id="cant-line-4999">over it? Most of us are motivated as hell to do anything to pursue our dreams </span><span id="cant-line-5000">until those around us remind us of the danger , the downside, our own </span><span id="cant-line-5001">limitations, and all the people before us that didn’ t make it. Sometimes the </span><span id="cant-line-5002">advice comes from a well-intentioned  place. They really believe they are </span><span id="cant-line-5003">doing it for our own good but if you let them, these same people will talk </span><span id="cant-line-5004">you out of your dreams, and your governor will help them do  it. </span><span id="cant-line-5005">That’ s one reaso n I invented the Cookie Jar. We must create a system that </span><span id="cant-line-5006">constantly reminds us who the fuck we are when we are at our best, because </span><span id="cant-line-5007">life is not going to pick us up when we fall. There will be forks in the road, </span><span id="cant-line-5008">knives in your fucking back, mountains to climb, and we are only capable of </span><span id="cant-line-5009">living up to the image we create for  ourselves. </span><span id="cant-line-5010">Prepare  yourself! </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5011">We know life can be hard, and yet we feel sorry for ourselves when it isn’t </span><span id="cant-line-5012">fair. From this point forward, accept the following as Goggins’ laws of </span><span id="cant-line-5013">nature: </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5014">You will be made fun of. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5015">You will feel insecure. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5016">You may not be the best all the time. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5017">You may be the only black, white, Asian, Latino, female, male, gay, </span><span id="cant-line-5018">lesbian or [fill in your identity here] in a given situation. </span><span id="cant-line-5019">There will be times when you feel alone.Get over  it! </span><span id="cant-line-5020">Our minds are fucking strong, they are our most powerful weapon, but we </span><span id="cant-line-5021">have stopped using them. We have access to so many more resources today </span><span id="cant-line-5022">than ever before and yet we are so much less capable than those who came </span><span id="cant-line-5023">before us. If you want to be one of the few to defy those trends in our ever- </span><span id="cant-line-5024">softening  society , you will have to be willing to go to war with yourself and </span><span id="cant-line-5025">create a whole new identity , which requires an open mind. It’s funny , being </span><span id="cant-line-5026">open minded is often tagged as new age or soft. Fuck that. Being open </span><span id="cant-line-5027">minded enough to find a way is old school. It’s what knuckle draggers do. </span><span id="cant-line-5028">And that’ s exactly what I  did. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5029">I borrow ed my friend Stokes’ bike (he also graduated in Class 235), and </span><span id="cant-line-5030">instead of running to work, I rode there and back every day. There was an </span><span id="cant-line-5031">elliptical trainer in the brand -new SEAL Team Five gym, and I hit it once </span><span id="cant-line-5032">and sometimes twice a day, with five layers of clothes on! Death Valley heat </span><span id="cant-line-5033">scared the shit out of me, so I simulated it. I suited up in three or four pairs </span><span id="cant-line-5034">of sweatpants, a few pull-over sweatshirts, a hoodie, and a fleece hat, all </span><span id="cant-line-5035">sealed up in a Gore -Tex shell. After two minutes on the elliptical my heart </span><span id="cant-line-5036">rate was at 170, and I stayed at it for two hours at a time. Before  or after that </span><span id="cant-line-5037">I’d hop on the rowing machine and bang out 30,000 meters—which is nearly </span><span id="cant-line-5038">twenty miles. I never did anything for ten or twenty minutes. My entire </span><span id="cant-line-5039">mindset was ultra. It had to be. Afterward I could be seen wringing my </span><span id="cant-line-5040">clothes out, like I’d just soaked them in a river. Most of the guys thought I </span><span id="cant-line-5041">was whacked out, but my old BUD/S instructor , SBG, fucking loved  it. </span><span id="cant-line-5042">That spring I was tasked as a land warfare instructor for SEALs at our base </span><span id="cant-line-5043">in Niland, California; a sorry scrap of Southern California desert, its trailer </span><span id="cant-line-5044">parks rampant with unemployed meth heads. Drugged -out drifters, who </span><span id="cant-line-5045">filtered through the disintegrating settlements on the Salton Sea, an inland </span><span id="cant-line-5046">body of water sixty miles from the Mexico border , were our only neighbors. </span><span id="cant-line-5047">Whenever I passed them on the street while out on a ten-mile ruck, they’d </span><span id="cant-line-5048">stare like I was an alien that had materialized into the real world  from one of </span><span id="cant-line-5049">their speed -addled  vision quests. Then again, I was dressed in three layers of </span><span id="cant-line-5050">clothes and a Gore -Tex jacket in peak hundred -degree  heat. I did look like </span><span id="cant-line-5051">some evil messenger from the way-out beyond ! By then my injuries had </span><span id="cant-line-5052">become manage able and I ran ten miles at a time, then hiked the hills around </span><span id="cant-line-5053">Niland for hours, weighed down with a fifty-pound  ruck.The Team guys I was training considered me an alien being too, and a few of </span><span id="cant-line-5054">them were more frightened of me than the meth heads. They thought </span><span id="cant-line-5055">something had happened to me on the battlefield out in that other desert </span><span id="cant-line-5056">where war wasn’ t a game. What  they didn’ t know was the battlefield for me </span><span id="cant-line-5057">was my own  mind. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5058">I drove back out to Death Valley to train and did a ten-mile run in a sauna </span><span id="cant-line-5059">suit. That motherfucker was hot as balls, but I had the hardes t race in the </span><span id="cant-line-5060">world ahead of me, and I’d run a hundred miles twice. I knew how that felt, </span><span id="cant-line-5061">and the prospect of having to take on an additional thirty -five miles petrified </span><span id="cant-line-5062">me. Sure, I talked a good game, projected all kinds of confidenc e, and raised </span><span id="cant-line-5063">tens of thousands of dollars, but part of me didn’ t know if I had what it took </span><span id="cant-line-5064">to finish the race, so I had to invent barbaric PT to give myself a  chance. </span><span id="cant-line-5065">It takes a lot of will to push yourself when you are all alone. I hated getting </span><span id="cant-line-5066">up in the mornin g knowing what the day held for me. It was very lonely , but </span><span id="cant-line-5067">I knew that on the Badwater course I’d reach a point where the pain would </span><span id="cant-line-5068">become unbeara ble and feel insurmountable. Maybe it would be at mile fifty </span><span id="cant-line-5069">or sixty , maybe later, but there would be a time when I’d want to quit, and I </span><span id="cant-line-5070">had to be able to slay the one-second  decisions in order to stay in the game </span><span id="cant-line-5071">and access my untapped 60  percent. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5072">During all the lonely hours of heat training, I’d started to dissect the quitting </span><span id="cant-line-5073">mind and realized that if I was going to perform close to my absolute </span><span id="cant-line-5074">potential and make the Warrior Foundation proud, I’d have to do more than </span><span id="cant-line-5075">answer the simple questions as they came up. I’d have to stifle  the quitting </span><span id="cant-line-5076">mind before it gained any traction at all. Before I ever asked myself, “Why? ” </span><span id="cant-line-5077">I’d need  my Cookie Jar on recall to convince me that despite what my body </span><span id="cant-line-5078">was saying, I was immune to  suffering. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5079">Because nobody  quits an ultra race or Hell Week in a split second. People </span><span id="cant-line-5080">make the decision to quit hours  before they ring that bell, so I needed to be </span><span id="cant-line-5081">present enough to recognize when my body and mind were starting to fail in </span><span id="cant-line-5082">order to short circuit the impulse to look for a way out long before I tumbled </span><span id="cant-line-5083">into that fatal funnel. Ignoring pain or blocking out the truth like I did at the </span><span id="cant-line-5084">San Diego One Day would not work this time, and if you are on the hunt for </span><span id="cant-line-5085">your 100 percent you should catalog your weaknesses and vulnerabilities. </span><span id="cant-line-5086">Don’ t ignore them. Be prepared for them, because in any endurance event, inany high-stress  environment, your weaknesses will surface like bad karma, </span><span id="cant-line-5087">build in volume, and overwhelm you. Unless you get ahead of them  first. </span><span id="cant-line-5088">This is an exercise in recognition and visualization. You must recognize </span><span id="cant-line-5089">what you are about to do, highlight what you do not like about it, and spend </span><span id="cant-line-5090">time visualizing  each and every obstacle you can. I was afraid of the heat, so </span><span id="cant-line-5091">in the run-up to Badw ater, I imagined new and more medieval self-torture </span><span id="cant-line-5092">rituals disguised as training sessions (or maybe it was the other way around). </span><span id="cant-line-5093">I told myself I was immune to suffering, but that didn’ t mean I was immune </span><span id="cant-line-5094">to pain. I hurt like everybody else, but I was committed to work ing my way </span><span id="cant-line-5095">around and throu gh it so it would not derail me. By the time I toed up to the </span><span id="cant-line-5096">line at Badwater at 6 a.m. on July 22, 2006, I’d moved my governor to 80 </span><span id="cant-line-5097">percent. I’d doubled my ceiling in six months, and you know what that </span><span id="cant-line-5098">guaranteed  me? </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5099">Jack fucking  shit. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5100">Badwater has a staggered start. Rookies started at 6 a.m., veteran runners </span><span id="cant-line-5101">had an 8 a.m. start, and the true contenders wouldn’ t take off until 10 a.m., </span><span id="cant-line-5102">which put them in Death Valley for peak heat. Chris Kostman was one </span><span id="cant-line-5103">hilarious son of a bitch. But he didn’ t know he’d given one hard </span><span id="cant-line-5104">motherfucker a serious tactical advantage. Not me. I’m talking about Akos </span><span id="cant-line-5105">Konya. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5106">Akos and I met up the night before at the Furnace Creek Inn, where all the </span><span id="cant-line-5107">athletes stayed. He was a first-timer  too, and he looked a hell of a lot better </span><span id="cant-line-5108">since the last time we saw one another . Despite his issues at the Hurt 100 (he </span><span id="cant-line-5109">finished by the way, in 35 hours and 17 minutes), I knew Akos was a stud, </span><span id="cant-line-5110">and since we were both in the first group I let him pace me through the </span><span id="cant-line-5111">desert. Bad  call! </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5112">For the first seventeen miles we were side by side, and we looked like an </span><span id="cant-line-5113">odd couple. Akos is a 5’7”, 122-pound  Hungarian. I was the biggest man in </span><span id="cant-line-5114">the field at 6’1”, 195 pounds, and the only black guy too. Akos was </span><span id="cant-line-5115">sponsored and dressed in a colorful, branded getup. I wore a torn grey tank </span><span id="cant-line-5116">top, black running shorts, and streamlined Oakley sunglasses. My feet and </span><span id="cant-line-5117">ankles were wrapped in compression tape and stuffed into broken -in but still </span><span id="cant-line-5118">springy running shoes. I didn’ t wear Navy SEAL gear or W arrior Foundationgarb. I preferred  to go incognito. I was the shadow figure filterin g into a new </span><span id="cant-line-5119">world of  pain. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5120">During my first Badwater </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5121">Although Akos set a fast pace, the heat didn’ t bother me, partly because it </span><span id="cant-line-5122">was early and because I’d heat trained so well. We were the two best runners </span><span id="cant-line-5123">in the 6 a.m. group by far, and when we passed the Furnace Creek Inn at </span><span id="cant-line-5124">8:40 a.m., some of the runners from the 10 a.m. group were outside, </span><span id="cant-line-5125">including Scott Jurek, the defending champion, Badwater record -holder , and </span><span id="cant-line-5126">an ultra legend. He must have known we were making great time, but I’m </span><span id="cant-line-5127">not sure he realized that he’d just glimpsed his stif fest competition. </span><span id="cant-line-5128">Not long after, Akos put some space between us, and at mile twenty -six, I </span><span id="cant-line-5129">started to realize  that, once again, I went out way too fast. I was dizzy and </span><span id="cant-line-5130">lightheaded, and I was dealing with GI issues. Translation: I had to shit on </span><span id="cant-line-5131">the side of the road. All of which stemmed from the fact that I was severely </span><span id="cant-line-5132">dehydrated. My mind spun with dire prognosis after dire progno sis. Excuses </span><span id="cant-line-5133">to quit piled up one after another . I didn’ t listen. I responded by taking care </span><span id="cant-line-5134">of my dehydration issue and pounding more water than I  wanted. </span><span id="cant-line-5135">I went through the Stovepipe Wells checkpoint at mile forty -two at 1:31 </span><span id="cant-line-5136">p.m., a full hour after Akos. I’d been on the race course for over seven and a </span><span id="cant-line-5137">half hours and was almost exclusively walking by then. I was proud just to </span><span id="cant-line-5138">have made it through Death Valley on my feet. I took a break, went to a </span><span id="cant-line-5139">proper bathroom, and changed my clothes. My feet had swolle n more than </span><span id="cant-line-5140">I’d expected, and my right big toe had been chafing the side of the shoe for </span><span id="cant-line-5141">hours, so stopping felt like sweet relief. I felt the bloom of a blood blister on </span><span id="cant-line-5142">the side of my left foot, but I knew better than to take off my shoes. Mostathletes size up their shoes to run Badwater , and even then, they cut out the </span><span id="cant-line-5143">big toe side panel to create space for swelling and to minimize chafing. I did </span><span id="cant-line-5144">not, and I had ninety more miles ahead of  me. </span><span id="cant-line-5145">I hiked the entire eighteen -mile climb to Towne Pass at 4,850 feet. As </span><span id="cant-line-5146">predicted, the sun dropped as I crested the pass, the air cooled, and I pulled </span><span id="cant-line-5147">on anoth er layer . In the military we always say we don’t rise to the level of </span><span id="cant-line-5148">our expectations, we fall to the level of our training, and as I hiked up the </span><span id="cant-line-5149">winding highwa y with my blister barking, I fell into the same rhythm I’d </span><span id="cant-line-5150">find on my long rucks in the desert around Niland. I wasn’ t running, but I </span><span id="cant-line-5151">kept a strong pace and covered a lot of  ground. </span><span id="cant-line-5152">I stuck to my script, ran the entire nine-mile descent, and my quads paid the </span><span id="cant-line-5153">price. So did my left foot. My blister was growing by the minute. I could feel </span><span id="cant-line-5154">it verging on hot-air-balloon  status. If only it would burst through my shoe </span><span id="cant-line-5155">like an old carto on, and continue to expand until it carried me into the clouds </span><span id="cant-line-5156">and dropped me onto the peak of Mount Whitney  itself. </span><span id="cant-line-5157">No such luck. I kept walking, and aside from my crew , which included, </span><span id="cant-line-5158">among others, my wife (Kate was crew chief) and mother , I didn’ t see </span><span id="cant-line-5159">anybody else. I was on an eternal ruck, marching beneath a black dome sky </span><span id="cant-line-5160">glittering with starlight. I’d been walking for so long I expected a swarm of </span><span id="cant-line-5161">runners to materialize at any moment, then leave me in their wake. But </span><span id="cant-line-5162">nobody showed. The only evidence of life on planet pain was the rhythm of </span><span id="cant-line-5163">my own hot breath, the burn of my cartoon blister , and the high beams and </span><span id="cant-line-5164">red taillights of road trippers blazing trails through the California night. That </span><span id="cant-line-5165">is, until the sun was ready to rise and a swarm finally did arrive at mile  110. </span><span id="cant-line-5166">I was exhausted and dehydrated by then, glazed in sweat, dirt, and salt, when </span><span id="cant-line-5167">horseflies began to dive bomb me one at a time. Two became four which </span><span id="cant-line-5168">became ten and fifteen. They beat their wings against my skin, bit my thighs, </span><span id="cant-line-5169">and craw led into my ears. This shit was biblical, and it was my very last test. </span><span id="cant-line-5170">My crew took turns swatting flies off my skin with a towel. I was in personal </span><span id="cant-line-5171">best territory already . I’d covered more than 110 miles on foot, and with </span><span id="cant-line-5172">“only” twenty -five miles to go there was no fucking way these devil flies </span><span id="cant-line-5173">would stop me. Would they? I kept marching, and my crew kept swatting </span><span id="cant-line-5174">flies, for the next eight  miles!Since watching Akos run away from me after mile seventeen, I hadn’ t seen </span><span id="cant-line-5175">another Badwater runner until mile 122 when Kate pulled up alongside  me. </span><span id="cant-line-5176">“Scott Jurek is two miles behind you,” she  said. </span><span id="cant-line-5177">We were more than twenty -six hours into the race, and Akos had already </span><span id="cant-line-5178">finished, but the fact that Jurek was just now catching me meant my time </span><span id="cant-line-5179">must have been pretty damn good. I hadn’ t run much, but all those Niland </span><span id="cant-line-5180">rucks made my hiking stride swift and strong. I was able to power hike </span><span id="cant-line-5181">fifteen -minute  miles, and got my nutrition on the move to save time. After it </span><span id="cant-line-5182">was all over, when I examined the splits and finishing times of all the </span><span id="cant-line-5183">competitors, I realized my biggest fear, the heat, had actually helped me. It </span><span id="cant-line-5184">was the great equalizer . It made fast runners  slow. </span><span id="cant-line-5185">With Jurek on the hunt, I was inspired to give it everything I had as I turned </span><span id="cant-line-5186">onto Whitney Portal Road and started the final thirteen -mile climb. I flashed </span><span id="cant-line-5187">onto my pre-race strategy  to walk the slopes and run the flats as the road </span><span id="cant-line-5188">switched back like a snake slithering into the clouds. Jurek wasn’ t pursuing </span><span id="cant-line-5189">me, but he was on the chase. Akos had finished in twenty -five hours and </span><span id="cant-line-5190">fifty-eight  minutes and Jurek hadn’ t been at his best that day. The clock was </span><span id="cant-line-5191">winding down on his effort to repeat as Badwater champion, but he had the </span><span id="cant-line-5192">tactical advantage of knowing Akos’ time in advance. He also knew his </span><span id="cant-line-5193">splits. Akos hadn’ t had that luxury, and somewhere on the highway he’d </span><span id="cant-line-5194">stopped for a thirty -minute  nap. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5195">Jurek wasn’ t alone. He had a pacer , a formidable runner in his own right </span><span id="cant-line-5196">named Dusty Olson who nipped at his heels. Word was Olson ran at least </span><span id="cant-line-5197">seventy miles of the race himself. I heard them approach from behind, and </span><span id="cant-line-5198">whenever the road switched back I could see them below me. Finally , at mile </span><span id="cant-line-5199">128, on the steepest part of the steepest road in this entire fucked -up race, </span><span id="cant-line-5200">they were right behind me. I stopped running, got out of the way, and </span><span id="cant-line-5201">cheered them  on. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5202">Jurek was the fastest ultra runne r in history at that point, but his pace wasn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-5203">electric that late in the game. It was consistent. He chopped down the mighty </span><span id="cant-line-5204">mountain with each deliberate step. He wore black running shorts, a blue </span><span id="cant-line-5205">sleeveless shirt, and a white baseball cap. Behind him, Olson had his long,shoulder length hair corralled with a bandana, otherwise their uniform was </span><span id="cant-line-5206">identical. Jurek was the mule and Olson was riding  him. </span><span id="cant-line-5207">“Come on, Jurker! Come on, Jurker! This is your race,” Olson said as they </span><span id="cant-line-5208">passed me up. “No one is better than you! No one!” Olson kept talking as </span><span id="cant-line-5209">they ran ahead, reminding Jurek that he had more to give. Jurek obliged and </span><span id="cant-line-5210">kept charging up the mountain. He left it all out on that unfor giving asphalt. </span><span id="cant-line-5211">It was amazing to  watch. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5212">Jurek wound up winning the 2006 edition of Badwater when he finished in </span><span id="cant-line-5213">twenty -five hours and forty -one minutes, seventeen minutes faster than </span><span id="cant-line-5214">Akos, who must have regretted his power nap, but that wasn’ t my concern. I </span><span id="cant-line-5215">had a race of my own to  finish. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5216">Whitney Portal Road winds up a parched, exposed rock escarp ment for ten </span><span id="cant-line-5217">miles, before finding shade in gathering stands of cedar and pine. Energized </span><span id="cant-line-5218">by Jurek and his crew , I ran most of the last seven miles. I used my hips to </span><span id="cant-line-5219">push my legs forward and every  single step was agony , but after thirty hours, </span><span id="cant-line-5220">eighteen minute s, and fifty-four seconds  of running, hiking, sweating, and </span><span id="cant-line-5221">suffering, I snapped the tape to the cheers of a small crowd. I’d wanted to </span><span id="cant-line-5222">quit thirty times . I had to mentally inch my way through 135 miles, but </span><span id="cant-line-5223">ninety runners competed that day , and I came in fifth  place.Akos and I after my second Badwater in 2007—I placed third and Akos came in second again </span><span id="cant-line-5224">I plodded over to a grassy slope in the woods and lay back on a bed of pine </span><span id="cant-line-5225">needles as Kate unlaced my shoes. That blister had fully colonized my left </span><span id="cant-line-5226">foot. It was so big it looked like a sixth toe, the color and texture of cherry </span><span id="cant-line-5227">bubble gum. I marveled at it while she removed the compression tape from </span><span id="cant-line-5228">my feet. Then I staggered to the stage to accept my medal from Kostman. I’d </span><span id="cant-line-5229">just finished one of the hardes t races on planet earth. I’d visualized that </span><span id="cant-line-5230">moment ten times at least and thought I’d be elated, but I wasn’ t.Blistered toe after Badwater </span><span id="cant-line-5231">SBG’ s email to Kostman. He was right: I did finish in the top 10 percent! </span><span id="cant-line-5232">He handed me my medal, shook my hand, and interviewed me for the crowd, </span><span id="cant-line-5233">but I was only half there. While he spoke, I flashed to the final climb and a </span><span id="cant-line-5234">pass above 8,000 feet, where the view was unreal. I could see all the way to </span><span id="cant-line-5235">Death Valley . Near the end of another horrible journey , I got to see where I </span><span id="cant-line-5236">came from. It was the perfect metaphor for my twisted life. Once again I was </span><span id="cant-line-5237">broken, destroyed twenty different ways, but I’d passed another evolution, </span><span id="cant-line-5238">another crucible , and my rewar d was a lot more than a medal and a few </span><span id="cant-line-5239">minutes with Kostman’ s microphone. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5240">It was a whole new  bar. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5241">I closed my eyes and saw Jurek and Olson, Akos and Karl Meltzer . All of </span><span id="cant-line-5242">them had somet hing I didn’ t. They understood how to drain every last drop </span><span id="cant-line-5243">and put themsel ves in a position  to win the world’ s most difficult races, and </span><span id="cant-line-5244">it was time to seek out that feeling for myself. I’d prepared like a madman. I </span><span id="cant-line-5245">knew myself and the terrain. I stayed ahead of the quitting mind, answered </span><span id="cant-line-5246">the simple questions, and stayed in the race, but there was more to be done. </span><span id="cant-line-5247">There was still somewhere higher for me to rise. A cool breez e rustled the </span><span id="cant-line-5248">trees, dried the sweat from my skin, and soothed my aching bones. It </span><span id="cant-line-5249">whispered in my ear and share d a secret which echoed in my brain like a </span><span id="cant-line-5250">drumbeat that wouldn’ t stop. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5251">There is no finish line, Goggins. Ther e is no finish  line.CHALLENGE #7 </span><span id="cant-line-5252">The main objective here is to slowly start to remove the governo r from your </span><span id="cant-line-5253">brain. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5254">First, a quick reminder of how this process works. In 1999, when I weighed </span><span id="cant-line-5255">297 pounds, my first run was a quarter mile. Fast forward to 2007, I ran 205 </span><span id="cant-line-5256">miles in thirty -nine hours, nonstop. I didn’ t get there overnight, and I don’t </span><span id="cant-line-5257">expect you to either . Your job is to push past your normal stopping  point. </span><span id="cant-line-5258">Whether you are running on a treadmill or doing a set of push -ups, get to </span><span id="cant-line-5259">the point where you are so tired and in pain that your mind is begging you </span><span id="cant-line-5260">to stop. Then push just 5 to 10 percent further . If the most push -ups you </span><span id="cant-line-5261">have ever done is one hundred in a workout, do 105 or 110. If you normally </span><span id="cant-line-5262">run thirty miles each week, run 10 percent more next  week. </span><span id="cant-line-5263">This gradual ramp -up will help prevent injury and allow your body and </span><span id="cant-line-5264">mind to slowly adapt to your new workload. It also resets your baseline, </span><span id="cant-line-5265">which is important because you’re about to increase your workload another </span><span id="cant-line-5266">5 to 10 percent the following week, and the week after  that. </span><span id="cant-line-5267">There is so much pain and suffering involved in physical challenges that it’s </span><span id="cant-line-5268">the best training to take command of your inner dialogue, and the newfound </span><span id="cant-line-5269">mental strength and confidence  you gain by continuing to push yourself </span><span id="cant-line-5270">physically will carry over to other aspects in your life. You will realize that </span><span id="cant-line-5271">if you were underperforming in your physical challenges, there is a good </span><span id="cant-line-5272">chance you are underperforming at school and work  too. </span><span id="cant-line-5273">The bottom line is that life is one big mind game. The only person you are </span><span id="cant-line-5274">playing against is yourself. Stick with this process and soon  what you </span><span id="cant-line-5275">thought was impossible will be something you do every fucking day of your </span><span id="cant-line-5276">life. I want to hear your stories. Post on social. Hashtags: #canthurtme </span><span id="cant-line-5277">#The40PercentRule #dontgetcomfortable.CHAPTER EIGHT </span><span id="cant-line-5278">8. TALENT NOT REQUIRED </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5279">THE NIGH T  BEFOR E  THE  FIRST  LONG - DIST ANCE  TRIA THLON  IN  MY  LIFE , I STOOD  WITH </span><span id="cant-line-5280">my mother on the deck of a sprawling, seven-million-dollar beach house in </span><span id="cant-line-5281">Kona watching the moonlight play on the water . Most people know Kona, a </span><span id="cant-line-5282">gorgeous town on the west coast of the island of Hawaii, and triathlons in </span><span id="cant-line-5283">general, thanks to the Ironman World Championships. Although there are far </span><span id="cant-line-5284">more Olympic distance and shorter sprint triathlons held around the world </span><span id="cant-line-5285">than there are Ironman events,  it was the original Ironman in Kona that </span><span id="cant-line-5286">placed the sport  on the interna tional radar . It starts with a 2.4-mile swim </span><span id="cant-line-5287">followed by a 112-mile bike ride, and closes with a marathon run. Add to </span><span id="cant-line-5288">that stiff and shifting winds and blistering heat corridors reflec ted by harsh </span><span id="cant-line-5289">lava fields, and the race reduces most competitors to open blisters of raw </span><span id="cant-line-5290">anguish, but I wasn’t here for that. I came to Kona to comp ete in a less </span><span id="cant-line-5291">celebrated form of even more intense masochism. I was there to compete for </span><span id="cant-line-5292">the title of  Ultraman. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5293">Over the next three days I woul d swim 6.2 miles, ride 261 miles, and run a </span><span id="cant-line-5294">double marathon, covering the entire perimeter of the Big Islan d of Hawaii. </span><span id="cant-line-5295">Once again, I was raising money for the Special Operations Warrior </span><span id="cant-line-5296">Foundation, and because I’d been written up and interviewed on camera </span><span id="cant-line-5297">after Badwater , I was invited by a multi -millionaire  I’d never met to stay in </span><span id="cant-line-5298">his absurd palace on the sand in the run-up to the Ultraman World </span><span id="cant-line-5299">Championships in November  2006. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5300">It was a generous gesture, but I was so focused on becoming the very best </span><span id="cant-line-5301">version of myself his glitz didn’t impress me. In my mind, I still hadn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-5302">achieved shit. If anything, stayin g in his house only inflated the chip on my </span><span id="cant-line-5303">shoulder . He would never have invited my wanna -be-thug ass to come chillwith him in Kona luxury back in the day. He only reached out because I’d </span><span id="cant-line-5304">become somebo dy a rich guy like him wanted to know . Still, I appreciated </span><span id="cant-line-5305">being able to show my mom a better life, and whenever I was offered a taste, </span><span id="cant-line-5306">I invited her to experience it with me. She’d swallowed more pain than </span><span id="cant-line-5307">anyone I’d ever known, and I wanted to remind her that we’d climbed out of </span><span id="cant-line-5308">that gutter , while I kept my own gaze locked at sewer level. We didn’ t live in </span><span id="cant-line-5309">that $7 a month  place in Brazil anymore, but I was still paying  rent on that </span><span id="cant-line-5310">motherfucker , and will be for the rest of my  life. </span><span id="cant-line-5311">The race launched from the beach beside the pier in downtown Kona—the </span><span id="cant-line-5312">same start line as the Ironman World Championships, but there wasn’ t much </span><span id="cant-line-5313">of a crowd for our race. There were only thirty athletes in the entire field </span><span id="cant-line-5314">compared to over 1,200 in the Ironman! It was such a small group I could </span><span id="cant-line-5315">look every one of my competitors in the eye and size them up, which is how </span><span id="cant-line-5316">I noticed the hardest man on the beach. I never did catch his name, but I’ll </span><span id="cant-line-5317">always rememb er him because he was in a wheelchair . Talk about heart. </span><span id="cant-line-5318">That man had a presence beyond his  stature. </span><span id="cant-line-5319">He was fucking  immense! </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5320">Ever since I’d started up in BUD/S, I’d been in search of people like that. </span><span id="cant-line-5321">Men and women with an uncommon way of thinking. One thing that </span><span id="cant-line-5322">surprised me about military special operations was that some of the guys </span><span id="cant-line-5323">lived so mainstream. They were n’t trying to push themselves every day of </span><span id="cant-line-5324">their lives, and I wanted to be around people who thought and trained </span><span id="cant-line-5325">uncommon 24/7, not just when  duty called. That man had every excuse in </span><span id="cant-line-5326">the world to be at home, but he was ready to do one of the hardest stage </span><span id="cant-line-5327">races in the world, something 99.9 percent of the public wouldn’ t even </span><span id="cant-line-5328">consider , and with just his two arms! To me, he was what ultra racing was all </span><span id="cant-line-5329">about, and its why after Badwater I’d become hooked on this world. Talent </span><span id="cant-line-5330">wasn’ t required for this sport. It was all about heart and hard work, and it </span><span id="cant-line-5331">delivered relentless challenge after relentless challenge, alway s demanding </span><span id="cant-line-5332">more. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5333">But that doesn’ t mean I was well-prepared  for this race. I still didn’ t own a </span><span id="cant-line-5334">bike. I borrowed one three weeks earlier from another frien d. It was a </span><span id="cant-line-5335">Griffin, an uber-high-end bicycle custom made for my friend who was even </span><span id="cant-line-5336">bigger than I was. I borrowed his clip-in shoes too, whic h were just shy ofclown -sized . I filled  the empty space with thick socks and compression tape, </span><span id="cant-line-5337">and didn’t take the time to learn bike mechanics before leaving for Kona. </span><span id="cant-line-5338">Changing tires, fixing chains and spokes, all the stuff I know how to do now, </span><span id="cant-line-5339">I hadn’t learned yet. I just borrowed the bike and logged over 1,000 miles in </span><span id="cant-line-5340">the three weeks prior to Ultra man. I’d wake up at 4 a.m. and get one </span><span id="cant-line-5341">hundred -mile rides in before work. On weekends I’d ride 125 miles, get off </span><span id="cant-line-5342">the bike and run a marathon, but I only did six training swims, just two in the </span><span id="cant-line-5343">open water , and in the ultra octagon all your weaknesses are  revealed. </span><span id="cant-line-5344">The ten-kilometer  swim should have taken me about two and a half hours to </span><span id="cant-line-5345">complete, but it took me over three, and it hurt. I was dressed in a sleeveless </span><span id="cant-line-5346">wetsuit for buoyancy , but it was too tight under my arms, and within thirty </span><span id="cant-line-5347">minutes my armpits began to chafe. An hour later the salty edge of my suit </span><span id="cant-line-5348">had become sandpaper that ripped my skin with every stroke . I switched </span><span id="cant-line-5349">from freestyle to side stroke and back again, desperate for comfo rt that never </span><span id="cant-line-5350">came. Every revolution of my arms cut my skin raw and bloody on both </span><span id="cant-line-5351">sides. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5352">Coming out of the water at Ultraman </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5353">Plus, the sea was choppy as hell. I drank sea water , my stomach flipped and </span><span id="cant-line-5354">flopped like a fish suffocating in fresh air, and I puked a half dozen times at </span><span id="cant-line-5355">least. Because of the pain, my poor mechanics, and the strong current, I </span><span id="cant-line-5356">swam a meandering line that stretched to seven and a half miles. All of that </span><span id="cant-line-5357">in order  to clear what was supposed to be a 6.2-mile swim. My legs were </span><span id="cant-line-5358">jelly when I staggered to shore , and my vision rocked like a teeter totter </span><span id="cant-line-5359">during an earthq uake. I had to lie down, then crawl behind the bathrooms, </span><span id="cant-line-5360">where I vomited again. Other swimmers gathered in the transition area,hopped into their saddles, and pedaled off into the lava fields in a blink. We </span><span id="cant-line-5361">still had a ninety -mile bike ride to knock off before the day was done, and </span><span id="cant-line-5362">they were gettin g after it while I was still on my knees. Right on time, those </span><span id="cant-line-5363">simple questions bubbled to the  surface. </span><span id="cant-line-5364">Why the fuck am I even out  here? </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5365">I’m not a  triathlete! </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5366">I’m chafed to hell, sick as fuck, and the first part of the ride is all  uphill! </span><span id="cant-line-5367">Why do you keep doing this to yourself, Goggins? </span><span id="cant-line-5368">I sounded like a whiny bitch, but I knew finding some comfor t would help </span><span id="cant-line-5369">me hem my vagina, so I paid no attention to the other athletes who eased </span><span id="cant-line-5370">through their transition. I had to focus on getting my legs under me and </span><span id="cant-line-5371">slowing my spun -out mind. First I got some food down, a little at a time. </span><span id="cant-line-5372">Then I treated the cuts under my arms. Most triathletes don’t change their </span><span id="cant-line-5373">clothes. I did. I slipped on some comfortable bike shorts and a lycra shirt, </span><span id="cant-line-5374">and fifteen minutes later I was upright, in the saddle, and climbing into the </span><span id="cant-line-5375">lava fields. For the first twenty minutes I was still nauseous. I pedaled and </span><span id="cant-line-5376">puked, replenished my fluids, and puked again. Through it all, I gave myself </span><span id="cant-line-5377">one job: stay in the fight! Stay in it long enough to find a  foothold. </span><span id="cant-line-5378">Ten miles later, as the road rose onto the shoulders of a giant volcano and the </span><span id="cant-line-5379">incline increased, I shook off my sea legs and found momentum. Riders </span><span id="cant-line-5380">appeared ahead like bogeys on a radar , and I picked them off, one by one. </span><span id="cant-line-5381">Victory was a cure-all. Each time I passed another motherfucker I got less </span><span id="cant-line-5382">and less sick. I was in fourteenth place when I saddled up, but by the time I </span><span id="cant-line-5383">approached the end of that ninety -mile leg there was only one man in front </span><span id="cant-line-5384">of me. Gary W ang, the favorite in the  race. </span><span id="cant-line-5385">As I hammered toward the finish line I could see a reporter and </span><span id="cant-line-5386">photographer from Triathlete  magazine interviewing him. None of them </span><span id="cant-line-5387">expected to see my black ass, and they all watched me carefully . During the </span><span id="cant-line-5388">four months since Badwater , I’d often dreamt of being in position to win an </span><span id="cant-line-5389">ultra race, and as I coasted past Gary and those reporters, I knew  the moment </span><span id="cant-line-5390">had arrived, and my expectations were  intergalactic.The following morning, we lined up for the second stage, a 171-mile bike </span><span id="cant-line-5391">ride through the mountains and back toward the west coast. Gary Wang had </span><span id="cant-line-5392">a buddy  in the race, Jeff Landauer , aka the Land Shark, and those two rode </span><span id="cant-line-5393">together . Gary had done the race before and knew the terrain. I didn’ t, and </span><span id="cant-line-5394">by mile one hundred, I was roughly six minutes of f the lead. </span><span id="cant-line-5395">As usual, my mother and Kate were my two-headed  support crew . They </span><span id="cant-line-5396">handed me replacement water bottles, packets of GU, and protein drinks </span><span id="cant-line-5397">from the side of the road, which  I consumed in motion to keep my glycogen </span><span id="cant-line-5398">and electrolyte levels up. I’d become much more scientific about my </span><span id="cant-line-5399">nutrition since that Myoplex and Ritz cracker meltdown in San Diego, and </span><span id="cant-line-5400">with the biggest climb of the day looming into view I needed to be ready to </span><span id="cant-line-5401">roar. On a bicycle, mountains produce pain, and pain was my business. As </span><span id="cant-line-5402">the road peaked in pitch, I put my head down and hammered as hard as I </span><span id="cant-line-5403">could. My lungs  heaved until they were flipped inside out and back again. </span><span id="cant-line-5404">My heart was a pounding bass line. When I crested the pass, my mom pulled </span><span id="cant-line-5405">up alongside me and hollered, “David, you are two minutes of f the lead!” </span><span id="cant-line-5406">Roger  that! </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5407">I curled into an aerodynamic crouch and shot downhill at over 40 mph. My </span><span id="cant-line-5408">borrowed Griffin was equipped with aero bars and I leaned  over them, </span><span id="cant-line-5409">focusing only on the white dotte d line and my perfect form. When the road </span><span id="cant-line-5410">leveled off I went all out and kept my pace up around 27 mph. I had a Land </span><span id="cant-line-5411">Shark and his buddy on an industrial -sized  hook, and was reeling them all </span><span id="cant-line-5412">the way  in. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5413">Until my front tire  blew . </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5414">Before I had time to react, I was off the bike, somersaulti ng over the </span><span id="cant-line-5415">handlebars into space. I could see it happening in slow motion, but time sped </span><span id="cant-line-5416">back up when I crash landed on my right side and my should er crumpled </span><span id="cant-line-5417">with blunt force . The side of my face skidded the asphalt until I stopped </span><span id="cant-line-5418">moving, and I rolled onto my back in shock. My mother slam med on her </span><span id="cant-line-5419">brakes, leapt from the car, and rushed over. I was bleeding in five places, but </span><span id="cant-line-5420">nothing felt broken. Except my helmet, which was cracked in two, my </span><span id="cant-line-5421">sunglasses, which were shattered, and my  bicycle.I’d run over a bolt that pierced the tire, tube, and rim. I didn’ t pay attention </span><span id="cant-line-5422">to my road rash, the pain in my shoulder , or the blood dribbli ng down my </span><span id="cant-line-5423">elbow and cheek. All I thought about was that bicycle. Once again, I was </span><span id="cant-line-5424">underprepared! I had no spare parts and didn’ t have any clue how to change </span><span id="cant-line-5425">a tube or a tire. I had rented a back -up bicycle  which was in my mom ’s </span><span id="cant-line-5426">rental car, but it was a heavy , slow piece of shit compared to that Griffin. It </span><span id="cant-line-5427">didn’ t even have  clip in pedals, so I called for the official race mechanics to </span><span id="cant-line-5428">assess the Griffin. As we waited, seconds piled up into twenty precious </span><span id="cant-line-5429">minutes and when mechanics arrived, they didn’ t have supplies to fix my </span><span id="cant-line-5430">front wheel either , so I hopped on my clunky back -up and kept  rolling. </span><span id="cant-line-5431">I tried not to think of bad luck and missed opportunities. I needed to finish </span><span id="cant-line-5432">strong and get myself within striking distance by the end of the day, because </span><span id="cant-line-5433">day three would bring a double marathon, and I was convinced that I was the </span><span id="cant-line-5434">best runner in the field. Sixteen miles from the finish line, the bike mechanic </span><span id="cant-line-5435">tracked me down. He’d repaired  my Griffin! I switched out my hardware for </span><span id="cant-line-5436">the second time and made up eight minutes on the leaders, finishing the day </span><span id="cant-line-5437">in third place, twenty -two minutes of f the lead. </span><span id="cant-line-5438">I crafted a simp le strategy for day three. Go out hard and build up a fat </span><span id="cant-line-5439">cushion over Gary and the Land Shark so that when I hit the inevitable wall, </span><span id="cant-line-5440">I’d have enough distance to maintain the overall lead all the way to the finish </span><span id="cant-line-5441">line. In other words, I didn’ t have any strategy at  all. </span><span id="cant-line-5442">I began my run at Boston Marathon qualifying pace. I pushed hard because I </span><span id="cant-line-5443">wanted my competitors to hear my splits and forfeit their souls as I built that </span><span id="cant-line-5444">big lead I’d anticipated. I knew I would blow up somewhere. That’ s ultra </span><span id="cant-line-5445">life. I just hoped  it would happe n late enough in the race that Gary and the </span><span id="cant-line-5446">Land Shark would be content to race one another for second and give up all </span><span id="cant-line-5447">hope of winning the overall  title. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5448">Didn’ t happen quite like  that. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5449">At mile thirty -five I was already in agony and walking more than I was </span><span id="cant-line-5450">running. By mile forty , I watche d both enemy vehicles pull up so their crew </span><span id="cant-line-5451">chiefs could peep my form. I was showing a ton of weakness,  which gave </span><span id="cant-line-5452">Gary and the Land Shark ammunition. The miles mounted too slowly . I </span><span id="cant-line-5453">hemorrhaged time. Luckily , by mile forty -five, Gary had blow n up too, butthe Land Shark was rock solid,  still on my ass, and I didn’ t have anything </span><span id="cant-line-5454">left to fight him off. Instead, as I suffered and staggered toward downtown </span><span id="cant-line-5455">Kona, my lead  evaporated. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5456">In the end, the Land Shark taught me a vital lesson. From day one, he had </span><span id="cant-line-5457">run his own race. My early burst on day three didn’ t faze him. He welcomed </span><span id="cant-line-5458">it as the ill-conceived  strategy that it was, focused on his own pace, waited </span><span id="cant-line-5459">me out, and took my soul. I was the first athlete to cross the finish line of the </span><span id="cant-line-5460">Ultraman that year, but as far as the clock was concerned I was no </span><span id="cant-line-5461">champion. While I came in first place on the run, I lost the overall race by </span><span id="cant-line-5462">ten minutes and took second place. The Land Shark was crowned  Ultraman! </span><span id="cant-line-5463">I watched him celebrate knowing exactly how I’d wasted an opportunity to </span><span id="cant-line-5464">win. I’d lost my vantage point. I’d never evaluated the race strategically and </span><span id="cant-line-5465">didn’ t have any backstops in place. Backstops are a versatile tool that I </span><span id="cant-line-5466">employ in all facets of my life. I was lead navigator when I operated in Iraq </span><span id="cant-line-5467">with the SEAL Teams, and “backstop” is a navigation term. It’s the mark I </span><span id="cant-line-5468">made on my map. An alert that we’d missed a turn or veered of f course. </span><span id="cant-line-5469">Let’s say you’re  navigating through the woods and you have to go one click </span><span id="cant-line-5470">toward a ridgeline, then make a turn. In the military , we would do a map </span><span id="cant-line-5471">study ahead of time and mark that turn on our maps, and another point about </span><span id="cant-line-5472">200 meters past that turn, and a third an additional 150 meters past the </span><span id="cant-line-5473">second mark. Those last two marks are your backstops. Typically , I used </span><span id="cant-line-5474">terrain features, like roads, creeks, a giant cliff in the countryside, or </span><span id="cant-line-5475">landmark buildings in an urban setting, so that when we hit them I knew </span><span id="cant-line-5476">we’d gone off course. That’ s what backstops are for, to tell you to turn </span><span id="cant-line-5477">around, reasses s, and take an alternative route to accomplish the same </span><span id="cant-line-5478">mission. I never left our base in Iraq without having three exit strategies. A </span><span id="cant-line-5479">primary route and two others, pinned to backstops, we could fall back to if </span><span id="cant-line-5480">our main route became  compromised. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5481">On day three of Ultraman, I tried to win with sheer will. I was all motor , no </span><span id="cant-line-5482">intellect. I didn’ t evaluate my condition, respect my opponents’ heart, or </span><span id="cant-line-5483">manage the clock well enough. I had no primary strategy , let alone </span><span id="cant-line-5484">alternative avenues to victory , and therefore I had no idea where to employ </span><span id="cant-line-5485">backstops. In retrospect I should  have paid more attention to my own clock, </span><span id="cant-line-5486">and my backstops should have been placed on my split times. When I sawhow fast I was running that first marathon, I should have been alarmed and </span><span id="cant-line-5487">eased off the gas. A slower first marathon may have left me with enough </span><span id="cant-line-5488">energy to drop the hammer once we were back in the lava fields on the </span><span id="cant-line-5489">Ironman course, heading towa rd the finish line. That’ s when you take </span><span id="cant-line-5490">someone’ s soul—at the end of a race, not at the beginning. I’d raced hard, </span><span id="cant-line-5491">but if I’d run smarter and hand led the bike situation better , I would have </span><span id="cant-line-5492">given myself a better chance to  win. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5493">Still, coming in second place at Ultraman was no disaster . I raised good </span><span id="cant-line-5494">money for families in need and booked more positive ink for the SEALs in </span><span id="cant-line-5495">Triathlete  and Competitor  magazines.  Navy brass took notice. One morning, </span><span id="cant-line-5496">I was called into a meeting with Admiral Ed W inters, a two-star Admiral and </span><span id="cant-line-5497">the top man at Naval Special Warfare Command. When you’r e an enlisted </span><span id="cant-line-5498">guy and hear an Admiral want s a word, your ass sort of puckers up. He </span><span id="cant-line-5499">wasn’ t supposed to seek me out. There was a chain of command in place </span><span id="cant-line-5500">specifically to prevent conversations between Rear Admirals and enlisted </span><span id="cant-line-5501">men like me. Without any warning that was all out the window , and I had a </span><span id="cant-line-5502">feeling it was my own  fault. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5503">Thanks to the positive media I’d generated, I had received orders to join the </span><span id="cant-line-5504">recruitment division in 2007, and by the time I was ordered into the </span><span id="cant-line-5505">Admiral’ s office I’d done plenty of public speaking on behalf of the Navy </span><span id="cant-line-5506">SEALs. But I was different than most of the other recruiters. I didn’ t just </span><span id="cant-line-5507">parrot the Navy’ s script. I alway s included my own life story , off the cuff. As </span><span id="cant-line-5508">I waited outside the Admiral’ s office I closed my eyes and flipped through </span><span id="cant-line-5509">memory files, searching for when and how I’d overstepped and embarrassed </span><span id="cant-line-5510">the SEALs. I was the picture of tension, sitting stiff and alert, sweating </span><span id="cant-line-5511">through my uniform when he opened the door to his  office. </span><span id="cant-line-5512">“Goggins,” he said, “good to see you, come on in.” I open ed my eyes, </span><span id="cant-line-5513">followed him inside, and stood straight as an arrow , locked at attention. “Sit </span><span id="cant-line-5514">down,” he said with a smile, gesturing to a chair facing his desk. I sat, but </span><span id="cant-line-5515">maintained my posture and avoided all eye contact. Admiral Winters sized </span><span id="cant-line-5516">me up. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5517">He was in his late fifties, and though he appeared relaxed, he maintained </span><span id="cant-line-5518">perfect posture. To become an Admiral is to rise through the ranks of tens of </span><span id="cant-line-5519">thousands. He’d been a SEAL since 1981, was an Operation s Officer atDEVGRU (Naval Special Warfare Development Group), and a Commander </span><span id="cant-line-5520">in Afghanistan and Iraq. At each stop he stood taller than the rest, and was </span><span id="cant-line-5521">among the strongest, smartest,  shrewdest, and most charismatic men the </span><span id="cant-line-5522">Navy had ever seen. He also fit a certain standard. Admiral Winters was the </span><span id="cant-line-5523">ultimate insider , and I was as outside the box as you could get in the United </span><span id="cant-line-5524">States  Navy . </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5525">“Hey , relax,” he said, “you aren’ t in any trouble. You’re doing a great job in </span><span id="cant-line-5526">recruiting.” He gestured to a file on his otherwise immaculate desk. It was </span><span id="cant-line-5527">filled with some  of my clips. “You’re representing us really well. But there’ s </span><span id="cant-line-5528">some men out there we need to do a better job of reaching out to, and I’m </span><span id="cant-line-5529">hoping you can  help.” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5530">That’ s when it finally hit me. A two-star Admiral needed my  help. </span><span id="cant-line-5531">The trouble we faced as an organization, he said, was that we were terrible at </span><span id="cant-line-5532">recruiting African Americans into the SEAL Teams. I knew that already . </span><span id="cant-line-5533">Black people made up only 1 percent of all special forces, even though we </span><span id="cant-line-5534">are 13 percent of the general population. I was just the thirty -sixth  African </span><span id="cant-line-5535">American ever to graduate BUD /S, and one of the reasons for that was we </span><span id="cant-line-5536">weren’ t hitting the best places to recruit black men into the SEAL teams, and </span><span id="cant-line-5537">we didn’ t have the right recruiters either . The military likes to think of itself </span><span id="cant-line-5538">as a pure meritocracy (it isn’t), which is why for decades this issue was </span><span id="cant-line-5539">ignored. I called Admiral Winters recently , and he had this to say about the </span><span id="cant-line-5540">problem, which was originally flagged by the Pentagon during the second </span><span id="cant-line-5541">Bush administration and sent to the Admiral’ s desk to  fix. </span><span id="cant-line-5542">“We were missi ng an opportunity to get great athletes into the teams and </span><span id="cant-line-5543">make the teams better ,” he said, “and we had places we needed to send </span><span id="cant-line-5544">people where, if they looked like me, they would be  compromised.” </span><span id="cant-line-5545">In Iraq, Admiral Winters made his name building elite counter terrorism </span><span id="cant-line-5546">forces. That’s one of the prima ry missions in special forces: to train allied </span><span id="cant-line-5547">military units so they can control social cancers like terrorism and drug </span><span id="cant-line-5548">trafficking and maintain stability within borders. By 2007, Al Qaeda had </span><span id="cant-line-5549">made inroads into Africa, allied  with existing extremist networks including </span><span id="cant-line-5550">Boko Haram and al Shabaab, and there was talk of building up </span><span id="cant-line-5551">counterterrorism forces in Somalia, Chad, Nigeria, Mali, Cameroon, BurkinaFaso, and Niger . Our operation s in Niger made international news in 2018 </span><span id="cant-line-5552">when four American special operations soldiers were killed in an ambush, </span><span id="cant-line-5553">drawing public scrutiny to the mission. But back in 2007, almost nobody </span><span id="cant-line-5554">knew we were about to get involved in West Africa, or that we lacked the </span><span id="cant-line-5555">personnel to get it done. As I sat in his office, what I heard was the time had </span><span id="cant-line-5556">finally come when we needed black people in special forces and our military </span><span id="cant-line-5557">leaders were clueless as to how to meet that need and entice more of us into </span><span id="cant-line-5558">the fold. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5559">It was all new information to me. I didn’ t know anything abou t the African </span><span id="cant-line-5560">threat. The only hostile terrain I knew about was in Afghanistan and Iraq. </span><span id="cant-line-5561">That is, until Admiral Winters dropped a whole new detail on me, and the </span><span id="cant-line-5562">military’ s problem officially became my problem. I’d report to my Captain </span><span id="cant-line-5563">and the Admira l, he said, and hit the road, visiting ten to twelve cities at a </span><span id="cant-line-5564">time, with a goal of spiking recruiting numbers in the POC (people of color) </span><span id="cant-line-5565">category . </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5566">We made the first stop on this new mission together . It was at Howard </span><span id="cant-line-5567">University , in Washington D.C., probably the best known histo rically black </span><span id="cant-line-5568">university in America. We’d dropped in to speak to the football team, and </span><span id="cant-line-5569">though I knew almost nothing about historically black colleges and </span><span id="cant-line-5570">universities, I knew students who attended them aren’ t usually the type to </span><span id="cant-line-5571">think of the military as an optimal career choice. Thanks to our country’ s </span><span id="cant-line-5572">history and the rampant racism  that continues to this day, black political </span><span id="cant-line-5573">thought trends left of center at these institutions, and if you’re recruiting for </span><span id="cant-line-5574">the Navy SEALs, there are definitely better choices than the Howard </span><span id="cant-line-5575">University practice field to find a willing ear. But this new focus required </span><span id="cant-line-5576">work in hostile territory , not mass enthusiasm. We were lookin g for one or </span><span id="cant-line-5577">two great men at each  stop. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5578">The Admiral and I walked onto the field, dressed in uniform, and I noted </span><span id="cant-line-5579">suspicion and disregard in the eyes of our audience. Admiral Winters had </span><span id="cant-line-5580">planned to introduce me, but our icy reception told me we had to go another </span><span id="cant-line-5581">way. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5582">“You were shy at first,” Admi ral Winters remembered, “but when it was </span><span id="cant-line-5583">time to speak, you looked at me and said, ‘I got this, sir .’”I launched right into my life story . I told those athletes what I’ve already told </span><span id="cant-line-5584">you, and said we were looking for guys with heart. Men who knew it was </span><span id="cant-line-5585">going to be hard tomorrow and the day after that and welc omed every </span><span id="cant-line-5586">challenge. Men who wanted to become better athletes, and smarter and more </span><span id="cant-line-5587">capable in all aspects of their life. We wanted guys who craved honor and </span><span id="cant-line-5588">purpose and were open minded enough to face their deepest  fears. </span><span id="cant-line-5589">“By the time you were done you could have heard a pin drop,” Admiral </span><span id="cant-line-5590">Winters  recalled. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5591">From then on, I was given command of my own schedule and budget and </span><span id="cant-line-5592">leeway to operate, as long as I hit certain recruitment thresho lds. I had to </span><span id="cant-line-5593">come up with my own material and knew that most people didn’t think they </span><span id="cant-line-5594">could ever beco me a Navy SEAL, so I broadened the messa ge. I wanted </span><span id="cant-line-5595">everyone who heard me out to know that even if they didn’ t walk in our </span><span id="cant-line-5596">direction they could still becom e more than they ever dreamed.  I made sure </span><span id="cant-line-5597">to cover my life in its entirety so if anyone had any excuse, my story would </span><span id="cant-line-5598">void all that out. My main drive  was to deliver hope that with or without the </span><span id="cant-line-5599">military anybody could change their life, so long as they kept an open mind, </span><span id="cant-line-5600">abandoned the path of least resistance, and sought out the difficult and most </span><span id="cant-line-5601">challenging tasks they could find. I was mining for diamonds in the rough </span><span id="cant-line-5602">like me. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5603">From 2007–200 9, I was on the road for 250 days a year and spoke to </span><span id="cant-line-5604">500,000 people at high schools  and universities. I spoke at inner city high </span><span id="cant-line-5605">schools in tough neighborhoods , at dozens of historically black colleges and </span><span id="cant-line-5606">universities, and at schools with all cultures, shapes, and shades well </span><span id="cant-line-5607">represented. I’d come a long way from fourth grade, when I couldn’ t stand </span><span id="cant-line-5608">up in front of a class of twenty kids and say my own name without </span><span id="cant-line-5609">stuttering. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5610">Teenagers are walking, talking bullshit detectors, but the kids who heard me </span><span id="cant-line-5611">speak bought into my message because everywhere I stopped, I also ran an </span><span id="cant-line-5612">ultra race and rolled my training runs and races into my overall recruitment </span><span id="cant-line-5613">strategy . I’d usually land in their town midweek, make my speeches, then </span><span id="cant-line-5614">run a race on Saturday and Sunday . In one stretch in 2007, I ran an ultra </span><span id="cant-line-5615">almost every weekend. There were fifty-mile races, 100-kilometer  races,100-mile races, and longer ones too. I was all about spreading the Navy </span><span id="cant-line-5616">SEAL legend that I loved, and wanted to be true and living our  ethos. </span><span id="cant-line-5617">Essentially , I had two full-time jobs. My schedule was jamm ed full, and </span><span id="cant-line-5618">while I know that having the flexibility to manage my own time contributed </span><span id="cant-line-5619">to my ability to train for and compete on the ultra circuit, I still put in fifty </span><span id="cant-line-5620">hours a week at work, clocking  in every day from about 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 </span><span id="cant-line-5621">p.m. My training hours came  in addition to, not instead of, my work </span><span id="cant-line-5622">commitments. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5623">I appeared at upwards of forty -five schools every month, and after each </span><span id="cant-line-5624">appearance I had to file an After Action Report (AAR), detailing how many </span><span id="cant-line-5625">separate events (an auditorium  speech, a workout, etc.) I organized, how </span><span id="cant-line-5626">many kids I spoke to, and how many of those were actually interested. These </span><span id="cant-line-5627">AARs went directly to my Captain and the  Admiral. </span><span id="cant-line-5628">I learned quickly that I was my own best prop. Sometimes I’d dress in a </span><span id="cant-line-5629">SEAL t-shirt with a Trident on it, run fifty miles to a speaking engagement, </span><span id="cant-line-5630">and show  up soaking wet. Or I would do push -ups for the first five minutes </span><span id="cant-line-5631">of my speech, or roll a pull-up bar out on stage and do pull-ups while I was </span><span id="cant-line-5632">talking. That’ s right, the shit you see me do on social media isn’t new. I’ve </span><span id="cant-line-5633">been living this life for eleven  years! </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5634">Wherever I stopped, I invited the kids who were interested to come train </span><span id="cant-line-5635">with me before or after school, or crew on one of my ultra races. Word got </span><span id="cant-line-5636">out and soon the media—local television, print, and radio—showed up, </span><span id="cant-line-5637">especially if I was running between cities to get to the next gig. I had to be </span><span id="cant-line-5638">articulate, well groomed, and do well in the races I  entered. </span><span id="cant-line-5639">I remem ber landing in Colorado the week of the legendary Leadville 100 </span><span id="cant-line-5640">trail race. The school year had just started, and on my first night in Denver I </span><span id="cant-line-5641">mapped out the five schools on my roster in relation to the trails I wanted to </span><span id="cant-line-5642">hike and run. At each stop I’d invite the kids to train with me, but warn them </span><span id="cant-line-5643">that my day started early . At 3 a.m. I would drive to a trailhead, meet up with </span><span id="cant-line-5644">all the students who dared to show, and by 4 a.m. we’d begin power hiking </span><span id="cant-line-5645">up one of Colorado’ s fifty-eight  summits above 14,000- feet. Then we’d </span><span id="cant-line-5646">sprint down the mountain to strengthen our quads. At 9 a.m. I hit another </span><span id="cant-line-5647">school, and then another . After the bell rang, I worked out with the football,track, or swim teams at the schools I visited, then ran back into the </span><span id="cant-line-5648">mountains to train until sunse t. All of that to recruit stud athletes and </span><span id="cant-line-5649">acclimatize for the highest altitude ultra marathon in the  world. </span><span id="cant-line-5650">The race started at 4 a.m. on a Saturday , departing from the city of Leadville, </span><span id="cant-line-5651">a working -class  ski town with frontier roots, and traversing a network of </span><span id="cant-line-5652">beautiful and harsh Rocky Mountain trails that range from 9,200 feet to </span><span id="cant-line-5653">12,600 feet in elevation. When I finished at 2 a.m. on Sunday , a teenager </span><span id="cant-line-5654">from Denver who attended a school I’d visited a few days earlier was </span><span id="cant-line-5655">waiting for me at the finish line. I didn’ t have a great race (I came in 14th </span><span id="cant-line-5656">place, rather than my typical top five), but I always made sure to finish </span><span id="cant-line-5657">strong, and when I sprinted home he approached me with a wide smile and </span><span id="cant-line-5658">said, “I drove two hours just to see you  finish!” </span><span id="cant-line-5659">The lesson: you never know who you’re affecting. My poor race results </span><span id="cant-line-5660">meant less than nothing to that young man because I’d helped open his eyes </span><span id="cant-line-5661">to a new world of possibility and capability that he sensed within himself. </span><span id="cant-line-5662">He’d followed me from his high school auditorium to Leadville because he </span><span id="cant-line-5663">was looking for absolute proof—my finishing the race—that it was possible </span><span id="cant-line-5664">to transcend the typical and beco me more, and as I cooled down and toweled </span><span id="cant-line-5665">off he asked me for tips so he could one day run all day and night through </span><span id="cant-line-5666">the mountains in his  backyard. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5667">I have several stories like that. More than a dozen kids came out to pace and </span><span id="cant-line-5668">crew for me at the McNaughton Park Trail Race, a 150-miler  held outside of </span><span id="cant-line-5669">Peoria, Illinois. Two dozen students trained with me in Minot, North Dakota. </span><span id="cant-line-5670">Together we ran the frozen tundra before sunrise in January when it was </span><span id="cant-line-5671">twenty below zero! Once I spoke at a school in a majority black </span><span id="cant-line-5672">neighborhood in Atlanta, and as I was leaving, a mother showed up with her </span><span id="cant-line-5673">two sons who had long dreame d of becoming Navy SEALs but kept it a </span><span id="cant-line-5674">secret because enlisting in the military wasn’ t considered cool in their </span><span id="cant-line-5675">neighborhood. When summer vacation broke out, I flew them to San Diego </span><span id="cant-line-5676">to live and train with me. I woke their asses up at 4 a.m. and beat them down </span><span id="cant-line-5677">on the beach like they were in a junior version of First Phase. They did not </span><span id="cant-line-5678">enjoy themselves, but they learned the truth about what it takes to live the </span><span id="cant-line-5679">ethos. Wherever I went, whether the students were interested in a military </span><span id="cant-line-5680">career or not, they always asked if they had the same hardware I had. Couldthey run a hundred miles in one day? What would it take to reach their full </span><span id="cant-line-5681">potential? This is what I’d tell  them: </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5682">Our culture has become hooked on the quick -fix, the life hack, efficiency . </span><span id="cant-line-5683">Everyone is on the hunt for that simple action algorithm that nets maximum </span><span id="cant-line-5684">profit with the least amount of effort. There’ s no denying this attitude may </span><span id="cant-line-5685">get you some of the trappings of success, if you’re lucky , but it will not lead </span><span id="cant-line-5686">to a calloused mind or self-mastery . If you want to master the mind and </span><span id="cant-line-5687">remove your governor , you’ll have to become addicted to hard work. </span><span id="cant-line-5688">Because passion  and obsession, even talent, are only useful tools if you have </span><span id="cant-line-5689">the work ethic to back them  up. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5690">My work ethic is the single most important factor in all of my </span><span id="cant-line-5691">accomplishments. Everything else is secondary , and when it comes to hard </span><span id="cant-line-5692">work, whether in the gym or on the job, The 40% Rule applies. To me, a </span><span id="cant-line-5693">forty -hour work week is a 40 percent effort. It may be satisfactory , but that’s </span><span id="cant-line-5694">another word for mediocrity . Don’ t settle for a forty -hour work week. There </span><span id="cant-line-5695">are 168 hours in a week! That means you have the hours to put in that extra </span><span id="cant-line-5696">time at work without skimping on your exercise. It means streamlining your </span><span id="cant-line-5697">nutrition, spending quality time with your wife and kids. It means scheduling </span><span id="cant-line-5698">your life like you’re on a twenty -four-hour mission every single  day. </span><span id="cant-line-5699">The number one excuse I hear from people as to why they don’t work out as </span><span id="cant-line-5700">much as they want to is that they don’t have time. Look, we all have work </span><span id="cant-line-5701">obligations, none of us want to lose sleep, and you’ll need time with the </span><span id="cant-line-5702">family or they’ll trip the fuck out. I get it, and if that’s your situation, you </span><span id="cant-line-5703">must win the  morning. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5704">When I was full-time with the SEAL s I maximized the dark hours before </span><span id="cant-line-5705">dawn. When my wife was sleeping, I would bang out a six- to ten-mile run. </span><span id="cant-line-5706">My gear was all laid out the night before, my lunch was packed, and my </span><span id="cant-line-5707">work clothes were in my locker at work where I’d shower before my day </span><span id="cant-line-5708">started at 7:30 a.m. On a typical day, I’d be out the door for my run just after </span><span id="cant-line-5709">4 a.m. and back by 5:15 a.m. Since that wasn’ t enough for me, and because </span><span id="cant-line-5710">we only owned one car, I rode my bike (I finally got my own shit!) twenty - </span><span id="cant-line-5711">five miles to work. I’d work from 7:30 a.m. to noon, and eat at my desk </span><span id="cant-line-5712">before or after my lunch break. During the lunch hour I’d hit the gym or do a </span><span id="cant-line-5713">four- to six-mile beach run, work  the afternoon shift and hop on my bike forthe twenty -five-mile ride home. By the time I was home at 7 p.m., I’d have </span><span id="cant-line-5714">run about fifteen miles, rocked fifty miles on the bike, and put in a full day at </span><span id="cant-line-5715">the office. I was always home for dinner and in bed by 10 p.m. so I could do </span><span id="cant-line-5716">it all over again the next day. On Saturdays I’d sleep in until 7 a.m., hit a </span><span id="cant-line-5717">three -hour workout, and spend the rest of the weekend with Kate. If I didn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-5718">have a race, Sundays were my active recovery days. I’d do an easy ride at a </span><span id="cant-line-5719">low heart rate, keeping my pulse below 110 beats per minute to stimulate </span><span id="cant-line-5720">healthy blood  flow. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5721">Maybe you think I’m a special case or an obsessive maniac. Fine, I won’ t </span><span id="cant-line-5722">argue with you. But what about my friend Mike? He’s a big-time financial </span><span id="cant-line-5723">advisor in New York City. His job is high pressure and his work day is a hell </span><span id="cant-line-5724">of a lot longer than eight hours. He has a wife and two kids, and he’s an ultra </span><span id="cant-line-5725">runner . Here’ s how he does it. He wakes up at 4 a.m. every weekday , runs </span><span id="cant-line-5726">sixty to ninety minutes each morning while his family is still snoozing, rides </span><span id="cant-line-5727">a bike to work and back and does a quick thirty -minute  treadmill run after he </span><span id="cant-line-5728">gets home. He goes out for longer runs on weekends, but he minimizes its </span><span id="cant-line-5729">impact on his family  obligations. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5730">He’s high-powered , wealthy as fuck, and could easily maintain his status quo </span><span id="cant-line-5731">with less effort and enjoy the sweet fruits of his labors, but he finds a way to </span><span id="cant-line-5732">stay hard because his labors are his sweetest fruits. And he makes time to get </span><span id="cant-line-5733">it all in by minimizing the amount of bullshit clogging his schedule. His </span><span id="cant-line-5734">priorities are clear , and he remains dedicated to his priorities. I’m not talking </span><span id="cant-line-5735">about general priorities here either. Each hour of his week is dedicated to a </span><span id="cant-line-5736">particular task and when that hour shows up in real time, he focuses 100 </span><span id="cant-line-5737">percent on that task. That’ s how I do it too, because that is the only way to </span><span id="cant-line-5738">minimize wasted  hours. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5739">Evaluate your life in its totality! We all waste so much time doing </span><span id="cant-line-5740">meaningless bullshit. We burn hours on social media and watching </span><span id="cant-line-5741">television, which by the end of the year would add up to entire days and </span><span id="cant-line-5742">weeks if you tabulated time like you do your taxes. You should, because if </span><span id="cant-line-5743">you knew the truth you’d deactivate your Facebook account STAT, and cut </span><span id="cant-line-5744">your cable. When you find yourself having frivolous conversations or </span><span id="cant-line-5745">becoming ensna red in activities that don’t better you in any way, move the </span><span id="cant-line-5746">fuck on!For years I’ve lived like a monk. I don’t see or spend time with a lot of </span><span id="cant-line-5747">people. My circle is very tight. I post on social media once or twice a week </span><span id="cant-line-5748">and I never check anybody else’s feeds because I don’t follow anyone. </span><span id="cant-line-5749">That’ s just me. I’m not saying you need to be that unfor giving, because you </span><span id="cant-line-5750">and I probably don’t share the same goals. But I know you have goals too, </span><span id="cant-line-5751">and room for improvement, or you wouldn’ t be reading my book, and I </span><span id="cant-line-5752">guarantee that if you audited your schedule you’d find time for more work </span><span id="cant-line-5753">and less  bullshit. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5754">It’s up to you to find ways to eviscerate your bullshit. How much time do </span><span id="cant-line-5755">you spend at the dinner table talking about nothing after the meal is done? </span><span id="cant-line-5756">How many calls and texts do you send for no reason at all? Look at your </span><span id="cant-line-5757">whole life, list your obligations and tasks. Put a time stamp on them. How </span><span id="cant-line-5758">many hours are required to shop, eat, and clean? How much sleep do you </span><span id="cant-line-5759">need? What’s your commute like? Can you make it there under your own </span><span id="cant-line-5760">power? Block everything into windows of time, and once your day is </span><span id="cant-line-5761">scheduled out, you’ll know how much flexibility you have to exercise on a </span><span id="cant-line-5762">given day and how to maximize  it. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5763">Perhaps you aren’ t looking to get fit, but have been dreaming of starting a </span><span id="cant-line-5764">business of your own, or have always wanted to learn a language or an </span><span id="cant-line-5765">instrument you’re obsessed with. Fine, the same rule applies. Analyze your </span><span id="cant-line-5766">schedule, kill your empty habits , burn out the bullshit, and see what’ s left. Is </span><span id="cant-line-5767">it one hour per day? Three? Now maximize that shit. That means listing your </span><span id="cant-line-5768">prioritized tasks every hour of the day. You can even narrow it down to </span><span id="cant-line-5769">fifteen -minute  windows, and don’t forget to include backstops in your day- </span><span id="cant-line-5770">to-day schedule. Remember how I forgot to include backstops in my race </span><span id="cant-line-5771">plan at Ultraman? You need backstops in your day-to-day schedul e too. If </span><span id="cant-line-5772">one task bleeds into overtime, make sure you know it, and begin to transition </span><span id="cant-line-5773">into your next prioritized task straight away . Use your smartphone for </span><span id="cant-line-5774">productivity hacks, not click bait. Turn on your calendar alerts . Have those </span><span id="cant-line-5775">alarms  set. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5776">If you audit your life, skip the bullshit, and use backstops, you’ll find time to </span><span id="cant-line-5777">do everything you need and want to do. But remember that you also need </span><span id="cant-line-5778">rest, so schedule that in. Listen to your body , sneak in those ten- to twenty - </span><span id="cant-line-5779">minute  power naps when necessary , and take one full rest day per week. If </span><span id="cant-line-5780">it’s a rest day, truly allow your mind and body to relax. Turn your phone off.Keep the comp uter shut down. A rest day means you should be relaxed, </span><span id="cant-line-5781">hanging with friends or family , and eating and drinking well,  so you can </span><span id="cant-line-5782">rechar ge and get back at it. It’s not a day to lose yourself in technology or </span><span id="cant-line-5783">stay hunched at your desk in the form of a damn question  mark. </span><span id="cant-line-5784">The whole point of the twenty -four-hour mission is to keep up a </span><span id="cant-line-5785">championship pace, not for a season or a year, but for your entire life! That </span><span id="cant-line-5786">requires quality rest and recover y time. Because there is no finish line. There </span><span id="cant-line-5787">is always more to learn, and you will always have weaknesses to strengthen </span><span id="cant-line-5788">if you want to become as hard as woodpecker lips. Hard enough to hammer </span><span id="cant-line-5789">countless miles, and finish that shit  strong! </span><span id="cant-line-5790">*** </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5791">In 2008, I was back in Kona for the Ironman World Championsh ips. I was in </span><span id="cant-line-5792">peak visibility mode for the Navy SEALs, and Commander Keith Davids, </span><span id="cant-line-5793">one of the best athletes I ever saw in the SEAL teams, and I were slated to </span><span id="cant-line-5794">do the race. The NBC Sports broadcast tracked our every move and turned </span><span id="cant-line-5795">our race within the race into a feature the announcers could cut to between </span><span id="cant-line-5796">clocking the main  contenders. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5797">Our entrance was straight out of a Hollywood pitch meeting.  While most </span><span id="cant-line-5798">athletes were deep into their pre-race rituals and getting psyched up for the </span><span id="cant-line-5799">longest day of their racing lives, we buzzed overhead in a C-130, jumped </span><span id="cant-line-5800">from 1,500 feet, and parachuted into the water , where we were scooped up </span><span id="cant-line-5801">by a Zodiac and motored to shore just four minutes before the gun. That was </span><span id="cant-line-5802">barely enough time for a blast of energy gel, a swig of water , and to change </span><span id="cant-line-5803">into our Navy SEAL triathlon  suits. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5804">You know by now that I’m slow  in the water , and Davids destroyed my ass </span><span id="cant-line-5805">on the 2.4-mile swim. I’m just as strong as he is on a bicycle, but my lower </span><span id="cant-line-5806">back tightened up that day and at the halfway point I had to stop and stretch </span><span id="cant-line-5807">out. By the time I coasted into the transition area after a 112-mile bike ride, </span><span id="cant-line-5808">Davids had thirty minutes on me, and early on in the marathon, I didn’ t do a </span><span id="cant-line-5809">great job of getting any of it back. My body was rebelling and I had to walk </span><span id="cant-line-5810">those early miles, but I stayed in the fight, and at mile ten found a rhythm </span><span id="cant-line-5811">and started clipp ing time. Somewhere ahead of me Davids blew up, and I </span><span id="cant-line-5812">inched closer . For a few miles  I could see him plodding in the distance,suffering in those lava fields, heat shimmering off the asphalt in sheets. I </span><span id="cant-line-5813">knew he wanted to beat me because he was a proud man. He was an Officer, </span><span id="cant-line-5814">a great operator , and a stud athlete. I wanted to beat him too. That’ s how </span><span id="cant-line-5815">Navy SEALs are wired, and I could have blown by him, but as I got closer I </span><span id="cant-line-5816">told myself to humble up. I caught him with just over two miles to go. He </span><span id="cant-line-5817">looked at me with a mix of respect and hilarious  exasperation. </span><span id="cant-line-5818">“Fucking Goggins,” he said with a smile. We’d jumped into the water </span><span id="cant-line-5819">together , started the race together , and we were gonna finish this thing </span><span id="cant-line-5820">together . We ran side by side for the final two miles, crossed the finish line, </span><span id="cant-line-5821">and hugged it out. It was terrific fucking  television.At the Kona Ironman finish line with Keith Davids*** </span><span id="cant-line-5822">Everything was going well in my life. My career was spit-shined  and </span><span id="cant-line-5823">gleaming, I’d made a name for myself in the sports world, and I had plans to </span><span id="cant-line-5824">get back onto the battlefield like a Navy SEAL should. But sometimes, even </span><span id="cant-line-5825">when you are doing everything right in life, shit storms appear and multiply . </span><span id="cant-line-5826">Chaos can and will descend without warning, and when (not if) that happens, </span><span id="cant-line-5827">there won’ t be anything you can do to stop  it. </span><span id="cant-line-5828">If you’re fortunate, the issues or injuries are relatively minor , and when </span><span id="cant-line-5829">those incidents crop up it’s on you to adjust and stay after it. If you get </span><span id="cant-line-5830">injured or other complications arise that prevent you from working on your </span><span id="cant-line-5831">primary passion , refocus your energy elsewhere. The activities we pursue </span><span id="cant-line-5832">tend to be our strengths because  its fun to do what we’re great at. Very few </span><span id="cant-line-5833">people enjoy working on their weaknesses, so if you’re a terrific  runner with </span><span id="cant-line-5834">a knee injury that will prevent you from running for twelve weeks, that is a </span><span id="cant-line-5835">great time to get into yoga, increasing your flexibility and your overall </span><span id="cant-line-5836">strength, which will make you a better and less injury -prone  athlete. If </span><span id="cant-line-5837">you’re a guitar player with a broken hand, sit down at the keys and use your </span><span id="cant-line-5838">one good hand to become a more versatile musician. The point is not to </span><span id="cant-line-5839">allow a setback to shatter our focus, or our detours to dictate our mindset. </span><span id="cant-line-5840">Always be ready to adjust, recalibrate, and stay after it to become better , </span><span id="cant-line-5841">somehow . </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5842">The sole reason I work out like I do isn’t to prepare for and win ultra races. I </span><span id="cant-line-5843">don’t have an athletic motive at all. It’s to prepare my mind for life itself. </span><span id="cant-line-5844">Life will always  be the most grueling endurance sport, and when you train </span><span id="cant-line-5845">hard, get uncomfortable, and callous your mind, you will become a more </span><span id="cant-line-5846">versatile compet itor, trained to find a way forward no matter what. Because </span><span id="cant-line-5847">there will be times when the shit life throws at you isn’t minor at all. </span><span id="cant-line-5848">Sometimes life hits you dead in the fucking  heart. </span><span id="cant-line-5849">My two-year stint on recruitm ent detail was due to end in 2009, and while I </span><span id="cant-line-5850">enjoyed my time inspiring the next gen, I was looking forward to getting </span><span id="cant-line-5851">back out and operating in the field. But before I left my post I planned one </span><span id="cant-line-5852">more big splash. I would ride a bicycle from the beach in San Diego to </span><span id="cant-line-5853">Annapolis, Maryland, in a legendary endurance road race, the Race Across </span><span id="cant-line-5854">America. The race was in June, so from January to May I spent all my freetime on the bike. I woke up at 4 a.m. and rode 110 miles before work, then </span><span id="cant-line-5855">rode twenty to thirty miles home at the end of a long work day . On weekends </span><span id="cant-line-5856">I put in at least one 200-mile day, and averaged over 700 miles per week. </span><span id="cant-line-5857">The race would take about two weeks to complete, there would be very little </span><span id="cant-line-5858">sleep involved, and I wanted to be ready for the greatest athletic  challenge of </span><span id="cant-line-5859">my entire  life. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5860">My RAAM training log </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5861">Then in early May everything capsized. Like a malfunctioning appliance, my </span><span id="cant-line-5862">heart went on the blink, almost overnight. For years my resting pulse rate </span><span id="cant-line-5863">was in the thirties. Suddenly it was in the seventies and eighties and any </span><span id="cant-line-5864">activity would spike it until I verged on collapse. It was as if I’d sprung aleak, and all my energy had been sucked from my body . A simple five- </span><span id="cant-line-5865">minute  bike ride would send my heart racing to 150 beats per minute. It </span><span id="cant-line-5866">pounded uncontrollably during a short walk up a single flight of  stairs. </span><span id="cant-line-5867">At first I thought it was from overtraining and when I went to the doctor , he </span><span id="cant-line-5868">agreed, but scheduled an echoc ardiogram for me at Balboa Hospital just in </span><span id="cant-line-5869">case. When I went in for the test, the tech gelled up his all-knowing  receiver </span><span id="cant-line-5870">and rolled it over my chest to get the angles he’d need while I lay on my left </span><span id="cant-line-5871">side, my head away from his monitor . He was a talker and kept bullshitting </span><span id="cant-line-5872">about a whole lot of nothing while he checked out all my chambers and </span><span id="cant-line-5873">valves. Everything looked solid, he said, until suddenly , forty -five minutes </span><span id="cant-line-5874">into the procedure, this chatty motherfucker stopped talking. Instead of his </span><span id="cant-line-5875">voice, I heard a lot of clicking  and zooming. Then he left the room and </span><span id="cant-line-5876">reappeared with another tech a few minutes later. They clicked, zoomed, and </span><span id="cant-line-5877">whispered, but didn’ t let me in on their big  secret. </span><span id="cant-line-5878">When people in white coats are treating your heart as a puzzle to be solved </span><span id="cant-line-5879">right in front of you, it’s hard not to think that you’re probably pretty fucked </span><span id="cant-line-5880">up. Part of me wanted answers immediately , because I was scared as shit, but </span><span id="cant-line-5881">I didn’t want to be a bitch and show my cards, so I opted to stay calm and let </span><span id="cant-line-5882">the professionals  work. Within a few minutes two other men walked into the </span><span id="cant-line-5883">room. One of them was a cardi ologist. He took over the wand , rolled it on </span><span id="cant-line-5884">my chest, and peered into the monitor with one short nod. Then he patted me </span><span id="cant-line-5885">on the shoulder like I was his fucking intern, and said, “Okay , let’s talk.” </span><span id="cant-line-5886">“You have an Atrial Septal Defect,” he said as we stood in the hallway , his </span><span id="cant-line-5887">techs and nurses pacing back and forth, disappearing into and reappearing </span><span id="cant-line-5888">from rooms on either side of us. I stared straight ahead and said nothing until </span><span id="cant-line-5889">he realized I had no idea what the fuck he was talking about. “You have a </span><span id="cant-line-5890">hole in your heart.” He scrunched his forehead and stroked his chin. “A </span><span id="cant-line-5891">pretty good -sized  one too.” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5892">“Holes don’ t just open in your heart, do  they?” </span><span id="cant-line-5893">“No, no,” he said with a laugh, “you were born with  it.” </span><span id="cant-line-5894">He went on to explain that the hole was in the wall between my right and left </span><span id="cant-line-5895">atria, which was a problem because when you have a hole between thechambers in your heart, oxygen ated blood mixes with the non-oxygenated </span><span id="cant-line-5896">blood. Oxygen is an essential element that every single one of our cells </span><span id="cant-line-5897">needs to survive . According to the doctor , I was only supplying about half of </span><span id="cant-line-5898">the necessary oxygen my muscles and organs needed for optimal </span><span id="cant-line-5899">performance. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5900">That leads to swelling in the feet and abdomen, heart palpitations, and </span><span id="cant-line-5901">occasional bouts  of shortness of breath. It certainly explained the fatigue I’d </span><span id="cant-line-5902">been feeling recently . It also impacts the lungs, he said, because it floods the </span><span id="cant-line-5903">pulmonary blood vessels with more blood than they can handle, which </span><span id="cant-line-5904">makes it much more difficult to recover from overexertion and illness. I </span><span id="cant-line-5905">flashed back to all the issues I had recovering after contra cting double </span><span id="cant-line-5906">pneumonia during my first Hell Week. The fluid I had in my lungs never </span><span id="cant-line-5907">fully receded. During subsequent Hell Weeks, and after getting into ultras, I </span><span id="cant-line-5908">found myself hocking up phlegm during and after finishing races. Some </span><span id="cant-line-5909">nights, there was so much fluid in me I couldn’ t sleep. I’d just sit up and spit </span><span id="cant-line-5910">phlegm into empty Gatorade bottles, wondering when that boring ritual </span><span id="cant-line-5911">would play itself out. Most people, when they become ultra obsessed, may </span><span id="cant-line-5912">deal with overuse injuries, but their cardiovascular system is finely tuned. </span><span id="cant-line-5913">Even though I was able to compete and accomplish so much with my broken </span><span id="cant-line-5914">body , I never felt that great. I’d learned to endure and overcom e, and as the </span><span id="cant-line-5915">doctor continued to download the essentials I realized that for the first time </span><span id="cant-line-5916">in my entire life, I’d also been pretty fucking lucky . You know , the </span><span id="cant-line-5917">backhanded brand of luck where you have a hole in your heart, but are </span><span id="cant-line-5918">thanking God that it hasn’ t killed you…yet. </span><span id="cant-line-5919">Because when you have an ASD like mine and you dive deep under water , </span><span id="cant-line-5920">gas bubbles, which are suppos ed to travel through the pulm onary blood </span><span id="cant-line-5921">vessels to be filtered through the lungs, might leak from that hole upon </span><span id="cant-line-5922">ascent, and recirculate as weapo nized embolisms that can clog blood vessels </span><span id="cant-line-5923">in the brain and lead to a stroke, or block an artery to the heart, and cause </span><span id="cant-line-5924">cardiac arrest. It’s like diving with a dirty bomb floating inside you, never </span><span id="cant-line-5925">knowing when or where it might go  off. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5926">I wasn’t alone in this fight. One out of every ten children are born with this </span><span id="cant-line-5927">same defect, but in most cases the hole closes on its own, and surgery isn’t </span><span id="cant-line-5928">required. In just under 2,000 American children each year, surgery is </span><span id="cant-line-5929">required, but is usually adminis tered before a patient starts school, becausethere are better screening processes these days. Most people my age who </span><span id="cant-line-5930">were born with ASD left the hospital in their mothers’ arms and lived with a </span><span id="cant-line-5931">potential deadly problem witho ut a clue. Until, like me, their heart started </span><span id="cant-line-5932">giving them trouble in their thirties. If I had ignored my warning signs, I </span><span id="cant-line-5933">could have dropped dead during a four-mile run. </span><span id="cant-line-5934">That’ s why if you’re in the military and are diagnosed with an ASD, you </span><span id="cant-line-5935">can’t jump out of airplanes or scuba dive, and if anyone had known of my </span><span id="cant-line-5936">condition there is no way the Navy ever would have let me become a SEAL. </span><span id="cant-line-5937">It’s astonishing I even made it through Hell Week, Badwater , or any of those </span><span id="cant-line-5938">other  races. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5939">“I’m truly amazed you could do all you’ve done with this condition,” the </span><span id="cant-line-5940">doctor  said. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5941">I nodded. He thought I was a medical marvel, some kind of outlier , or simply </span><span id="cant-line-5942">a gifted athlete blessed with amazing luck. To me, it was just further </span><span id="cant-line-5943">evidence that I didn’ t owe my accomplishments to God-given  talent or great </span><span id="cant-line-5944">genetics. I had a fucking hole in my heart! I was running  on a tank </span><span id="cant-line-5945">perpetually half full, and that meant my life was absolute proof of what’ s </span><span id="cant-line-5946">possible when someone dedicate s themselves to harnessing the full power of </span><span id="cant-line-5947">the human  mind. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5948">Three days later I was in  surgery. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5949">And boy did the doctor fuck that one up. First off, the anesthesia didn’ t take </span><span id="cant-line-5950">all the way, which meant I was half awake as the surgeon sliced into my </span><span id="cant-line-5951">inner thigh, inserted a catheter into my femoral artery , and once it reached </span><span id="cant-line-5952">my heart, deplo yed a helix patch through that catheter and moved it into </span><span id="cant-line-5953">place, supposedly patching the hole in my heart. Meanwhile, they had a </span><span id="cant-line-5954">camera down my throat, which I could feel as I gagged and struggled to </span><span id="cant-line-5955">endure the two-hour-long procedure. After all of that, my troubles were </span><span id="cant-line-5956">supposed to have been over. The doctor mentioned that it would take time </span><span id="cant-line-5957">for my heart tissue to grow around and seal the patch, but after a week he </span><span id="cant-line-5958">cleared me for light  exercise. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5959">Roger that, I thought, as I dropped to the floor to do a set of push -ups as </span><span id="cant-line-5960">soon as I got home. Almost  immediately my heart went into atrialfibrillation, also known as a-fib. My pulse spiked from 120 to 230, back to </span><span id="cant-line-5961">120 then up to 250. I felt dizzy  and had to sit down as I stared at my heart </span><span id="cant-line-5962">rate monitor , while my breathin g normalized. Once again my resting heart </span><span id="cant-line-5963">rate was in the eighties. In other words, nothing had changed. I called the </span><span id="cant-line-5964">cardiologist who tagged it a minor side effect and begged patience. I took </span><span id="cant-line-5965">him at his word and rested for a few more days then hopped on the bike for </span><span id="cant-line-5966">an easy ride home from work. At first all went well but after about fifteen </span><span id="cant-line-5967">miles, my heart went into a-fib once again. My pulse rate bounced from 120 </span><span id="cant-line-5968">to 230 and back again across the imaginary graph in my mind’ s eye with no </span><span id="cant-line-5969">rhythm whatsoever . Kate drove me straight to Balboa Hospital. After that </span><span id="cant-line-5970">visit, and second and third opinions, it was clear that the patch had either </span><span id="cant-line-5971">failed or was insuf ficient to cover the entire hole, and that I’d need a second </span><span id="cant-line-5972">heart  surgery. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5973">The Navy didn’ t want any part of that. They feared further complications </span><span id="cant-line-5974">and suggested I scale back my lifestyle, accept my new normal, and a </span><span id="cant-line-5975">retirement package. Yeah, right . Instead, I found a better doctor at Balboa </span><span id="cant-line-5976">who said we’d have to wait several months before we could even </span><span id="cant-line-5977">contemplate another heart surgery. In the meantime, I couldn’ t jump or dive, </span><span id="cant-line-5978">and obviously couldn’ t operate in the field, so I stayed in recruitment. It was </span><span id="cant-line-5979">a different life, no doubt, and I was tempted to feel sorry for myself. After </span><span id="cant-line-5980">all, this thing that hit me out of the clear blue changed the entire landscape of </span><span id="cant-line-5981">my military career , but I’d been training for life, not ultra races, and I </span><span id="cant-line-5982">refused to hang my  head. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5983">I knew that if I maintained a victim’ s mentality I wouldn’ t get anything at all </span><span id="cant-line-5984">out of a fucked -up situation, and I didn’ t want to sit home defeated all day </span><span id="cant-line-5985">long. So I used the time to perfect my recruitment presentation. I wrote up </span><span id="cant-line-5986">sterling AARs and became much more detail oriented in my administrative </span><span id="cant-line-5987">work. Does that sound boring to you? Fuck yes, it was boring! But it was </span><span id="cant-line-5988">honest, necessary work, and I used it to keep my mind sharp for when the </span><span id="cant-line-5989">moment came that I’d be able to drop back into the fight for  real. </span><span id="cant-line-5990">Or so I  hoped. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-5991">A full fourteen months after the first surgery, I was once again rolling </span><span id="cant-line-5992">through a hospital corridor on my back, staring at the fluorescent lights in </span><span id="cant-line-5993">the ceiling, headed to pre-op, with no guarantees. While the techs and nursesshaved me down and prepped me up, I thought about all I’d accomplished in </span><span id="cant-line-5994">the milit ary and wondered, was it enough? If the docs couldn’ t fix me this </span><span id="cant-line-5995">time would I be willing to retire, satisfied? That question lingered in my </span><span id="cant-line-5996">head until the anesthesiologist placed an oxygen mask over my face and </span><span id="cant-line-5997">counted down softly in my ear. Just before lights out, I heard the answer </span><span id="cant-line-5998">erupt from the abyss of my jet-black  soul. </span><span id="cant-line-5999">Fuck  no!After second heart sur geryCHALLENGE #8 </span><span id="cant-line-6000">Schedule it  in! </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6001">It’s time to compartmentalize your day. Too many of us have become </span><span id="cant-line-6002">multitaskers, and that’s created a nation of half-asses . This will be a three - </span><span id="cant-line-6003">week  challeng e. During week one, go about your normal schedule, but take </span><span id="cant-line-6004">notes. When do you work? Are you working nonstop or checking your </span><span id="cant-line-6005">phone (the Moment app will tell you)? How long are your meal breaks? </span><span id="cant-line-6006">When do you exercise, watch TV, or chat to friends? How long is your </span><span id="cant-line-6007">commute? Are you driving? I want you to get super detailed and document </span><span id="cant-line-6008">it all with timestamps. This will be your baseline, and you’ll find plenty of </span><span id="cant-line-6009">fat to trim.

When you work, only work on one thing at a time, think </span><span id="cant-line-6015">about the task in front of you and pursue it relentlessly . When it comes time </span><span id="cant-line-6016">for the next task on your schedu le, place that first one aside, and apply the </span><span id="cant-line-6017">same  focus. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6018">Make sure your meal breaks are adequate but not open -ended , and schedule </span><span id="cant-line-6019">in exercise and rest too.

UNCOMMON AMONGST </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6027">UNCOMMON </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6028">THE ANESTHESIA  TOOK  HOLD , AND  I FELT  MYSELF  WHEELING  BACKW ARD  UNTIL  I </span><span id="cant-line-6029">landed in a scene from my past. We were humping through the jungle in the </span><span id="cant-line-6030">dead of night. Our movement was stealthy and silent, but swift. Had to be. </span><span id="cant-line-6031">He who hits first wins the fight, most of the  time. </span><span id="cant-line-6032">We crested a pass, took shelter beneath a thick stand of towerin g mahogany </span><span id="cant-line-6033">trees in the triple canopy jungle, and tracked our targets through night vision </span><span id="cant-line-6034">goggles. Even without sunlight,  the tropical heat was intense and sweat slid </span><span id="cant-line-6035">down the side of my face like dew drops on a window pane. I was twenty - </span><span id="cant-line-6036">seven  years old, and my Platoon  and Rambo  fever dreams had become real </span><span id="cant-line-6037">as fuck. I blinked twice, exhaled, and on the OIC’ s signal, opened  fire. </span><span id="cant-line-6038">My entire body reverberated with the rhythm of the M60, a belt-fed machine </span><span id="cant-line-6039">gun, firing 500–650 rounds per minute. As the one-hundred -round  belt fed </span><span id="cant-line-6040">the grow ling machine and flared from the barrel, adrenaline flooded my </span><span id="cant-line-6041">bloodstream and saturated my brain. My focus narrowed. There was nothing </span><span id="cant-line-6042">else but me, my weapon, and the tar get I was shredding with zero  apologies. </span><span id="cant-line-6043">It was 2002, I was fresh out of BUD/S, and as a full-time Navy SEAL, I was </span><span id="cant-line-6044">now officially one of the world’ s most fit and deadly warriors and one of the </span><span id="cant-line-6045">hardest men alive. Or so I thoug ht, but this was years before my descent into </span><span id="cant-line-6046">the ultra rabbit hole. September 11th was still a fresh, gaping wound in the </span><span id="cant-line-6047">American collective consciousness, and its ripple effects changed everything </span><span id="cant-line-6048">for guys like us. Combat was no longer a mythical state of mind we aspired </span><span id="cant-line-6049">to. It was real and ongoing in the mountains, villages, and cities ofAfghanistan. Meanwhile, we were moored in fucking Malaysia, awaiting </span><span id="cant-line-6050">orders, hoping to join the  fight. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6051">And we trained like  it. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6052">After BUD/S, I moved on to SEAL Qualification Training, where I officially </span><span id="cant-line-6053">earned my Trident before landing in my first platoon. Trainin g continued </span><span id="cant-line-6054">with jungle warfare exercises in Malaysia. We rappelled and fast-roped  up </span><span id="cant-line-6055">and down from hovering helicopters. Some men were trained as snipers, and </span><span id="cant-line-6056">since I was the biggest man in the unit—my weight was back up to 250 </span><span id="cant-line-6057">pounds by then—I scored the job of carrying the Pig, the nickname for the </span><span id="cant-line-6058">M60 because it sounded like the grunt of a barnyard  hog.SQT graduation (note the blood stains from the T rident being punched into my chest) </span><span id="cant-line-6059">Most people dreaded Pig detail, but I was obsessed with that gun. The </span><span id="cant-line-6060">weapon alone was twenty pounds, and each belt of one-hundred  rounds </span><span id="cant-line-6061">weighed in at seven pounds. I carried six to seven of those (one on the gun,four on my waist, and one in a pouch strapped to my rucksack), the weapon, </span><span id="cant-line-6062">and my fifty-pound  ruck everywhere we went and was expected to move just </span><span id="cant-line-6063">as fast as every one else. I had no choice. We train as we fight, and live </span><span id="cant-line-6064">ammo is necess ary to mimic true combat so we could perfec t the SEAL </span><span id="cant-line-6065">battle maxim: shoot, move, communicate. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6066">That meant keeping barrel discr etion on point. We couldn’ t let our weapon </span><span id="cant-line-6067">spray just anywhere. That’ s how friendly fire incidents happen, and it takes </span><span id="cant-line-6068">great muscle discipline and attention to detail to know where you’re aiming </span><span id="cant-line-6069">in relati on to the location of your teammates at all times, especially when </span><span id="cant-line-6070">armed with the Pig. Maintainin g a high standard of safety and delivering </span><span id="cant-line-6071">deadly force on-target when duty calls is what make s an average SEAL a </span><span id="cant-line-6072">good  operator . </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6073">Most people think once you’re a SEAL you’re always in the circle, but that’s </span><span id="cant-line-6074">not true. I learned quickly that we were constantly being judged, and the </span><span id="cant-line-6075">second I was unsafe, whether I was still a new guy or a veteran operator , I’d </span><span id="cant-line-6076">be out! I was one of three new guys in my first platoon, and one of them had </span><span id="cant-line-6077">to have his gun taken away because he was so unsafe. For ten days, we </span><span id="cant-line-6078">moved through the Malaysian jungle, sleeping in hammocks, paddling </span><span id="cant-line-6079">dugouts, carryin g our weapons all day and night, and he was stuck hauling a </span><span id="cant-line-6080">fucking broomstick like the Wicked Witch of the West. Even then he </span><span id="cant-line-6081">couldn’ t hack it and wound up getting booted. Our officers in that first </span><span id="cant-line-6082">platoon kept everybody honest, and I respected them for  it. </span><span id="cant-line-6083">“In combat, nobody just turns  into Rambo,” Dana De Coster told me </span><span id="cant-line-6084">recently . Dana was second in command on my first platoon with SEAL </span><span id="cant-line-6085">Team Five. These days he’s Director of Operations at BUD/S. “We push </span><span id="cant-line-6086">ourselves hard so when bullets do start flying we fall back on really good </span><span id="cant-line-6087">training, and it’s important that the point where we fall back is so high, we </span><span id="cant-line-6088">know we’re gonna outperform the enemy . We may not become Rambo, but </span><span id="cant-line-6089">we’ll be damn  close.” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6090">A lot of people are fascinated by the weaponry and gunfights SEALs utilize </span><span id="cant-line-6091">and engage in, but that was never my favorite part of the job. I was damn </span><span id="cant-line-6092">good at it, but I preferred going to war with myself. I’m talking about strong </span><span id="cant-line-6093">physical training , and my first platoon delivered that too. We would go on </span><span id="cant-line-6094">long run-swim -runs most mornings before work. We weren’ t just gettingmiles in either . We were compet ing, and our officers led from the front. Our </span><span id="cant-line-6095">OIC and Dana, his second, were two of the best athletes in the entire platoon </span><span id="cant-line-6096">and my Platoon  Chief, Chris Beck (who now goes by Kristin Beck, and is </span><span id="cant-line-6097">one of most famous trans women on Twitter; talk about being the only! ), was </span><span id="cant-line-6098">a hard motherfucker  too. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6099">“It’s funny ,” Dana said, “[the OIC and I] never really talked about our </span><span id="cant-line-6100">philosophy on PT. We just comp eted. I wanted to beat him and he wanted to </span><span id="cant-line-6101">beat me, and that got people talking about how hard we were getting after </span><span id="cant-line-6102">it.” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6103">There was never a doubt in my mind that Dana was off his damn rocker . I </span><span id="cant-line-6104">remember before we shipped out for Indonesia, with stops in Guam, </span><span id="cant-line-6105">Malaysia, Thailand, and Korea, we did a number of training dives off San </span><span id="cant-line-6106">Clemente Island. Dana was my swim buddy , and one morning he challenged </span><span id="cant-line-6107">me to do a training dive in fifty-five-degree  water without a wetsuit because </span><span id="cant-line-6108">that’s how the predecessors to the SEALs did it when they prepared the </span><span id="cant-line-6109">beaches in Normandy for the famous D-Day invasion during W orld W ar II. </span><span id="cant-line-6110">“Let’ s go old school and dive in shorts with our dive knives,” he  said. </span><span id="cant-line-6111">He had the animalistic mentali ty I thrived on, and I wasn’ t about to back </span><span id="cant-line-6112">down from that challenge. We swam and dove together all over Southeast </span><span id="cant-line-6113">Asia, where we trained elite military units in Malaysia and sharpened the </span><span id="cant-line-6114">skills of Thai Navy SEALs—the  crew of frogmen who saved the soccer kids </span><span id="cant-line-6115">in the cave in the summer of 2018. They were engaged with an Islamist </span><span id="cant-line-6116">insur gency in South Thailand. Wherever we deployed, I loved those PT </span><span id="cant-line-6117">mornings above all else. Pretty soon, every man in that platoon was </span><span id="cant-line-6118">competing against everyone else, but no matter how hard I tried I couldn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-6119">seem to catch our two of ficers and usually came in third place. Didn’ t matter . </span><span id="cant-line-6120">It wasn’t important who won because everybody was capping personal bests </span><span id="cant-line-6121">almost every day, and that’s what stayed with me. The power of a </span><span id="cant-line-6122">competitive environment to amp up an entire platoon’ s commitment and </span><span id="cant-line-6123">achievement! </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6124">This was exactl y the environment I’d been dreaming of when I classed up </span><span id="cant-line-6125">for BUD/S. We were all living the SEAL ethos, and I couldn’ t wait to see </span><span id="cant-line-6126">where it took us individually and as a unit once we tagged into the fight. Butas war raged in Afghanistan, all we could do was sit tight and hope our </span><span id="cant-line-6127">number was  called. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6128">We were  in a Korean bowling alley when we watched the invasion of Iraq </span><span id="cant-line-6129">together . It was depressing as hell. We had been training hard for an </span><span id="cant-line-6130">opportunity like that. Our found ation had been reinforced with all that PT, </span><span id="cant-line-6131">and filled out with robust weapons and tactical training. We’d become a </span><span id="cant-line-6132">deadly unit frothing to be a part of the action, and the fact that we were </span><span id="cant-line-6133">passed over again pissed us all off. So we took it out on one another every </span><span id="cant-line-6134">morning. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6135">Navy SEALs were treated like rock stars at the bases we visited around the </span><span id="cant-line-6136">world, and some of the guys partied like it. In fact, most SEALs enjoyed </span><span id="cant-line-6137">their share of big nights out, but not me. I’d gotten into the SEALs by living </span><span id="cant-line-6138">a Spartan lifestyle and felt my job at night was to rest, rechar ge, and get my </span><span id="cant-line-6139">body and mind right for battle again the next day. I was forever mission - </span><span id="cant-line-6140">ready , and my attitu de earned respect from some, but our OIC tried to </span><span id="cant-line-6141">influence me to let go a little and become “one of the  boys.” </span><span id="cant-line-6142">I had great respect for our OIC. He’d graduated from the Naval Academy </span><span id="cant-line-6143">and the University of Cambridg e. He was clearly smart, a stud athlete, and a </span><span id="cant-line-6144">great leader , on his way to claiming a coveted spot on DEV GRU, so his </span><span id="cant-line-6145">opinion mattered  to me. It mattered to all of us, because he was responsible </span><span id="cant-line-6146">for evaluating us and those evaluations have a way of following you around </span><span id="cant-line-6147">and af fecting your military career going  forward. </span><span id="cant-line-6148">On pape r, my first evaluation was solid. He was impressed with my skills </span><span id="cant-line-6149">and all-out effort, but he also dropped some off the record wisdom. “You </span><span id="cant-line-6150">know , Goggins,” he said, “you’d understand the job a little better if you hung </span><span id="cant-line-6151">out with the guys more. That’ s when I learn the most about operating in the </span><span id="cant-line-6152">field, hanging with the boys, hearing their stories. It’s important to be part of </span><span id="cant-line-6153">the group.” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6154">His words were  a reality check  that hurt. Clearly , the OIC, and probably </span><span id="cant-line-6155">some of the other guys, though t I was a little different. Of course I was! I </span><span id="cant-line-6156">came from fucking nothing! I didn’t get recruited to the Naval  Academy . I </span><span id="cant-line-6157">didn’ t even know where the fuck Cambridge was. I wasn’ t raised around </span><span id="cant-line-6158">pools. I had to teach myself to swim. Fuck, I shouldn’ t have even been aSEAL, but I made it, and I thought that made me part of the group, but now I </span><span id="cant-line-6159">realized I was part of the T eams—not the  brotherhood. </span><span id="cant-line-6160">I had to go out and socialize with the guys after hours to prove my value? </span><span id="cant-line-6161">That was a big ask for an introvert like  me. </span><span id="cant-line-6162">Fuck  that. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6163">I’d arriv ed in that platoon because of my intense dedication and I wasn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-6164">about to let up. While people were out at night I was reading up on tactics, </span><span id="cant-line-6165">weaponry , and war. I was a perpetual student! In my mind I was training for </span><span id="cant-line-6166">opportunities that didn’ t even exist yet. Back then you couldn’ t screen to join </span><span id="cant-line-6167">DEVGRU until after you finished your second platoon, but I was already </span><span id="cant-line-6168">preparing for that opportunity , and I refused to compromise who I was to </span><span id="cant-line-6169">conform to their unwritten  rules. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6170">DEVGRU (and the Army’ s Delta Force) are considered the very best within </span><span id="cant-line-6171">the best of special operations. They get the tip of the spear missions, like the </span><span id="cant-line-6172">Osama Bin Laden raid, and from that point on, I decided I wouldn’ t and </span><span id="cant-line-6173">couldn’ t be satisfied just being  a vanilla Navy SEAL. Yeah, we were all </span><span id="cant-line-6174">uncommon, hard motherfuckers compared to civilians, but now I saw I was </span><span id="cant-line-6175">uncommon even among the uncommon, and if that’s who I was, then so the </span><span id="cant-line-6176">fuck be it. I may as well separate myself even more. Not long after that </span><span id="cant-line-6177">evaluation, I won the morning race for the first time. I passed up Dana and </span><span id="cant-line-6178">the OIC in the last half mile and never looked  back. </span><span id="cant-line-6179">Platoon assignments last for two years, and by the end of our deployment </span><span id="cant-line-6180">most of the guys  were ready for a breather before tackling their next platoon, </span><span id="cant-line-6181">which judging by the wars we were involved in were almost guaranteed to </span><span id="cant-line-6182">take them into combat. I didn’ t want or need a break because the uncommon </span><span id="cant-line-6183">among uncommon don’ t take  breaks! </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6184">After my first evaluation I started studying the other branches in the military </span><span id="cant-line-6185">(Coast Guard not included) and read up on their special forces. Navy SEALs </span><span id="cant-line-6186">like to think that we’re the best of them all, but I wanted to see for myself. I </span><span id="cant-line-6187">suspected all the branches empl oyed a few individuals who stood out in the </span><span id="cant-line-6188">worst environm ents. I was on a hunt to find and train with those guys </span><span id="cant-line-6189">because I knew they could make  me better . Plus, I’d read that Army RangerSchool was known as one of the best, if not the best, leadership schools in </span><span id="cant-line-6190">the entire military , so during my first platoon, I put seven chits in with my </span><span id="cant-line-6191">OIC hoping to get approval to go to Army Ranger School between </span><span id="cant-line-6192">deployments. I wanted to spong e more knowledge, I told him, and become </span><span id="cant-line-6193">more skilled as a special  operator . </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6194">Chits are specia l requests, and my first six were ignored. I was a new guy, </span><span id="cant-line-6195">after all, and some thought my focus should remain within Naval Special </span><span id="cant-line-6196">Warfare, rather than stray into the dreaded Army . But I’d earned my own </span><span id="cant-line-6197">reputation after serving two years in my first platoon, and my seventh </span><span id="cant-line-6198">request went up the ladder to the CO in charge of Seal Team Five. When he </span><span id="cant-line-6199">signed of f, I was  in. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6200">“Goggins,” my OIC said after giving me the good news, “you are the type of </span><span id="cant-line-6201">motherfucker who wishes you were a POW just to see if you have what it </span><span id="cant-line-6202">takes to  last.” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6203">He was onto me. He knew the kind of person I was becoming— the type of </span><span id="cant-line-6204">man willing to challenge myself to the nth degree. W e shook hands. The OIC </span><span id="cant-line-6205">was off to DEVGRU, and there was a chance we’d meet there soon. He told </span><span id="cant-line-6206">me that with two ongoing wars, for the first time DEVGRU had opened their </span><span id="cant-line-6207">recruitment process to include  guys off their first platoon. By always </span><span id="cant-line-6208">searching for more and preparing my mind and body for opportunities that </span><span id="cant-line-6209">didn’ t yet exist, I was one of a handful of men on the West Coast approved </span><span id="cant-line-6210">by SEAL Team Five brass to screen for Green Team, the training program </span><span id="cant-line-6211">for DEVGRU, just before I left for Army Ranger  School. </span><span id="cant-line-6212">The Green Team screening process unfolds over two days. The first day is </span><span id="cant-line-6213">the physical fitness portion, which included a three -mile run, a 1,200- meter </span><span id="cant-line-6214">swim, three minutes of sit-ups and push -ups, and a max set of pull-ups. I </span><span id="cant-line-6215">smoked everybo dy, because my first platoon had made me a much stronger </span><span id="cant-line-6216">swimmer and a better runner . Day two was the interview , which was more </span><span id="cant-line-6217">like an interroga tion. Only three men from my screening class of eighteen </span><span id="cant-line-6218">guys were appro ved for Green Team. I was one of them, which theoretically </span><span id="cant-line-6219">meant that after my second platoon I’d be one step closer to joining </span><span id="cant-line-6220">DEVGRU. I could hardly wait. It was December 2003, and as imagined, my </span><span id="cant-line-6221">special forces career was zooming into hyperspace because I kept provingmyself to be the most uncommon of motherfuckers, and remai ned on track </span><span id="cant-line-6222">to become that One  Warrior . </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6223">A few weeks later, I arrived in Fort Benning, Geor gia, for Army Ranger </span><span id="cant-line-6224">School. It was early December , and as the only Navy guy in a class of 308 </span><span id="cant-line-6225">men, I was greeted with skepticism by the instructors because a few classes </span><span id="cant-line-6226">before mine, a couple of Navy SEALs quit in the middle of training. Back </span><span id="cant-line-6227">then they used to send Navy SEALs to Ranger School as punishment, so </span><span id="cant-line-6228">they may not have been the best representatives. I’d been beggi ng to go, but </span><span id="cant-line-6229">the instructors didn’ t know that yet. They thought I was just another cocky </span><span id="cant-line-6230">special ops guy. Within hours they stripped me and everyone  else of our </span><span id="cant-line-6231">uniforms and reputations until we all looked the same. Officers lost rank, </span><span id="cant-line-6232">and minted special forces warriors like me became nobodies with a hell of a </span><span id="cant-line-6233">lot to  prove. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6234">On day one, we were split into three companies and I was appointed first </span><span id="cant-line-6235">sergeant in command of Bravo company . I got the job because the original </span><span id="cant-line-6236">first sergeant had been asked to recite the Ranger Creed after a beat down on </span><span id="cant-line-6237">the pull-up bar, and he was so tired he fucked it up. To Rangers, their creed </span><span id="cant-line-6238">is everything. Our Ranger Instru ctor (RI) was livid as he took stock of Bravo </span><span id="cant-line-6239">company , all of us locked at  attention. </span><span id="cant-line-6240">“I don’t know where you think  you men are, but if you expec t to become </span><span id="cant-line-6241">Rangers then I expect you to know our creed.” His eyes found me. “I know </span><span id="cant-line-6242">for a fact Old Navy here doesn’ t know the Ranger  Creed.” </span><span id="cant-line-6243">I’d been studying it for months and could have recited it while standing on </span><span id="cant-line-6244">my head. For ef fect, I cleared my throat and got  loud. </span><span id="cant-line-6245">“Recognizing that I volunteered as a Ranger , fully knowing the hazards of </span><span id="cant-line-6246">my chosen profession, I will always endeavor to uphold the prestige, honor , </span><span id="cant-line-6247">and high spirit de corps of the  Rangers!” </span><span id="cant-line-6248">“Very surpri…” He tried to cut me of f, but I wasn’ t done. </span><span id="cant-line-6249">“Acknowledging the fact that a Ranger is a more elite Soldier who arrives at </span><span id="cant-line-6250">the cutting edge of battle by land, sea, or air, I accept the fact that as aRanger my country expects me to move further , faster , and fight harder than </span><span id="cant-line-6251">any other  Solider!” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6252">The RI nodded with a wry smile, but this time stayed out of my  way. </span><span id="cant-line-6253">“Never shall I fail my comrades! I will always keep myself mentally alert, </span><span id="cant-line-6254">physically strong, and morally straight, and I will shoulder more than my </span><span id="cant-line-6255">share of the task whatever it may be, 100 percent and then  some! </span><span id="cant-line-6256">“Gallantly will I show the world that I am a specially selected and well- </span><span id="cant-line-6257">trained  Soldier!  My courtesy to superior officers, neatness of dress, and care </span><span id="cant-line-6258">of equipment shall set the example for others to  follow! </span><span id="cant-line-6259">“Ener getically will I meet the enemies of my country! I shall defeat them on </span><span id="cant-line-6260">the field of battle for I am better trained and will fight with all my might! </span><span id="cant-line-6261">Surrender is not a Ranger word! I will never leave a fallen comrade to fall </span><span id="cant-line-6262">into the hands of the enemy and under no circumstances will I ever </span><span id="cant-line-6263">embarrass my  country! </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6264">“Readily will I display the intestinal fortitude required to fight on to the </span><span id="cant-line-6265">Ranger objective and complete the mission though I be the lone  survivor! </span><span id="cant-line-6266">“Rangers lead the  way!” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6267">I recited all six stanzas, and afterward he shook his head in disbelief, and </span><span id="cant-line-6268">mulled the ideal way to get the last laugh. “Congratulations, Goggins,” he </span><span id="cant-line-6269">said, “you are now first  sergeant.” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6270">He left me there , in front of my platoon, speechless. It was now my job to </span><span id="cant-line-6271">march our platoon around and make sure every man was prepared for </span><span id="cant-line-6272">whatever lay in front of us. I became part boss, part big broth er, and full- </span><span id="cant-line-6273">time quasi -instructor . In Ranger School it’s hard enough to get yourself </span><span id="cant-line-6274">squared away enough to gradua te. Now I had to look after a hundred men </span><span id="cant-line-6275">and make sure they had their shit together , too. </span><span id="cant-line-6276">Plus, I still had to go through the same evolutions as everyone else, but that </span><span id="cant-line-6277">was the easy part and actually gave me a chance to chill out. For me the </span><span id="cant-line-6278">physical punishment was more than manageable, but the way I went about </span><span id="cant-line-6279">accomplishing those physical tasks had shifted. In BUD/S I’d always leadmy boat crews, often with tough love, but in general I didn’ t care how the </span><span id="cant-line-6280">guys in the other boat crews were doing or if they quit. This time, I wasn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-6281">just putting out, I was also looking after everybody . If I saw someone having </span><span id="cant-line-6282">trouble with navigation, patrolling, keeping up on a run, or staying awake all </span><span id="cant-line-6283">night, I made sure we all rallied together to help. Not everybody wanted to. </span><span id="cant-line-6284">The training was so dif ficult that when some guys weren’ t on the clock being </span><span id="cant-line-6285">graded, they did the bare minimum and found opportunities to rest and hide. </span><span id="cant-line-6286">In my sixty -nine days at Ranger School I didn’ t coast for a single second. I </span><span id="cant-line-6287">was becoming a true  leader . </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6288">The whole point of Ranger School is to give every man a taste of what it </span><span id="cant-line-6289">takes to lead a high-level  team. The field exercises were like an operator ’s </span><span id="cant-line-6290">scavenger hunt blended with an endurance race. Over the course of six </span><span id="cant-line-6291">testing phases we were evaluate d on navigation, weapons, rope techniques, </span><span id="cant-line-6292">reconnaissance, and overall leadership. The field tests were notorious for </span><span id="cant-line-6293">their Spartan brutality and capped three separate phases of  training. </span><span id="cant-line-6294">First, we were split into groups of twelve men and together spent five days </span><span id="cant-line-6295">and four nights in the foothills for Fort Benning phase. We were given very </span><span id="cant-line-6296">little food to eat—one or two MREs per day—and only a couple of hours </span><span id="cant-line-6297">sleep per night, as we raced the clock to navigate cross -country  terrain </span><span id="cant-line-6298">between station s where we’d knock off a series of tasks to prove our </span><span id="cant-line-6299">proficiency in a particular skill. Leadership in the group rotated between </span><span id="cant-line-6300">men. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6301">Mountain phase  was exponentially harder than Fort Benning. Now we were </span><span id="cant-line-6302">grouped into teams of twenty -five men to navigate the mountains  in north </span><span id="cant-line-6303">Geor gia, and buddy , Appalachia gets cold as fuck in wintertime. I’d read </span><span id="cant-line-6304">stories about black soldiers with Sickle Cell Trait dying during Mountain </span><span id="cant-line-6305">Phase, and the Army wanted me to wear special dog tags with a red casing to </span><span id="cant-line-6306">alert medics if something went wrong, but I was leading men and didn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-6307">want my crew to think of me as some sickly child, so the red casing never </span><span id="cant-line-6308">quite found its way to my dog  tags. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6309">In the mountain s we learned how to rappel and rock climb, among other </span><span id="cant-line-6310">mountaineering skills, and became proficient in ambush techniques and </span><span id="cant-line-6311">mountain patrol . To prove it we went out on two separate, four-night  field </span><span id="cant-line-6312">training exercises, known as FTXs. A storm blew in during our second FTX.Thirty -mile-per-hour winds howled with ice and snow . We didn’ t haul </span><span id="cant-line-6313">sleeping bags or warm clothes, and again we had very little food. All we </span><span id="cant-line-6314">could use to keep warm was a poncho liner and one another , which was an </span><span id="cant-line-6315">issue because the rancid odor in the air was our own. We’d burned so many </span><span id="cant-line-6316">calories without  proper nutrition, we’d lost all our fat and were incinerating </span><span id="cant-line-6317">our own muscle mass for fuel. The putrid stink made our eyes water . It </span><span id="cant-line-6318">triggered the gag reflex. Visibility narrowed to a few feet. Guys wheezed, </span><span id="cant-line-6319">coughed, and jackhammered, their eyes wide with terror . I thought for sure </span><span id="cant-line-6320">someone was gonna die from frostbite, hypothermia, or pneumonia that </span><span id="cant-line-6321">night. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6322">Whenever you stop to sleep during field tests, rest is brief and you’re </span><span id="cant-line-6323">required to maintain security in four directions, but in the face of that storm, </span><span id="cant-line-6324">Bravo platoon buckled. These were generally very hard men with a ton of </span><span id="cant-line-6325">pride, but they were focused on survival above all else. I understood the </span><span id="cant-line-6326">impulse, and the instructors didn’ t mind because we were in weather </span><span id="cant-line-6327">emer gency mode, but to me that presented an opportunity to stand apart and </span><span id="cant-line-6328">lead by example. I looked at that winter storm as a platform to become </span><span id="cant-line-6329">uncommon among uncommon  men. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6330">No matter who you are, life will present you similar opportunities where you </span><span id="cant-line-6331">can prove to be uncommon. There are people in all walks of life who relish </span><span id="cant-line-6332">those moments, and when I see them I recognize them immediately because </span><span id="cant-line-6333">they are usually  that motherfucker who’ s all by himself. It’s the suit who’ s </span><span id="cant-line-6334">still at the office at midnight while everyone else is at the bar, or the badass </span><span id="cant-line-6335">who hits the gym directly after coming off a forty -eight -hour op. She’s the </span><span id="cant-line-6336">wildland firefig hter who instead of hitting her bedroll, sharpens her </span><span id="cant-line-6337">chainsaw after working a fire for twenty -four hours. That mentality is there </span><span id="cant-line-6338">for all of us. Man, woman, straight, gay, black, white, or purple fucking </span><span id="cant-line-6339">polkadot. All of us can be the person who flies all day and night only to </span><span id="cant-line-6340">arrive home to a filthy house, and instead of blaming family or roommates, </span><span id="cant-line-6341">cleans it up right then because they refuse to ignore duties  undone. </span><span id="cant-line-6342">All over the world amazing human beings like that exist. It doesn’ t take </span><span id="cant-line-6343">wearing a uniform. It’s not about all the hard schools they graduated from, </span><span id="cant-line-6344">all their patches and medals. It’s about wanting it like there’ s no tomorrow— </span><span id="cant-line-6345">because there might not be. It’s about thinking of everybody  else before </span><span id="cant-line-6346">yourself and developing your own code of ethics that sets you apart fromothers. One of those ethics is the drive to turn every negative into a positive, </span><span id="cant-line-6347">and then when shit starts flying, being prepared to lead from the  front. </span><span id="cant-line-6348">My thinking on that Geor gia mountaintop was that, in a real-world  scenario, </span><span id="cant-line-6349">a storm like that would provide the perfect cover for an enemy attack, so I </span><span id="cant-line-6350">didn’ t group up and seek warmth. I dialed deeper , welcomed the carnage of </span><span id="cant-line-6351">ice and snow , and held the western perimeter like it was my duty—because it </span><span id="cant-line-6352">damn well was! And I loved every second of it. I squinted into the wind, and </span><span id="cant-line-6353">as hail stung my cheeks, I screamed into the night from the depths of my </span><span id="cant-line-6354">misunderstood  soul. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6355">A few guys heard me, popped out of the tree line to the north, and stood tall. </span><span id="cant-line-6356">Then another guy emer ged to the east, and another on the edge of the south - </span><span id="cant-line-6357">facing  slope. They were all shivering, wrapped in their measly poncho liners. </span><span id="cant-line-6358">None of them wanted to be there, but they rose up and did their duty. In spite </span><span id="cant-line-6359">of one of the most brutal storms in Ranger School history , we held a </span><span id="cant-line-6360">complete perime ter until the instructors radioed us to come in from the cold. </span><span id="cant-line-6361">Literally . They put up a circus tent. We filed in and huddled  up until the </span><span id="cant-line-6362">storm  passed. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6363">The final weeks in Ranger School are called Florida Phase, a ten-day FTX in </span><span id="cant-line-6364">which fifty men navigate the panhandle, GPS point by GPS point, as a single </span><span id="cant-line-6365">unit. It started with a static line jump from an aircraft at 1,500 feet into frigid </span><span id="cant-line-6366">swamplands near Fort Walton Beach. We waded and swam across rivers, set </span><span id="cant-line-6367">up rope bridges , and with our hands and feet shimmied back to the other </span><span id="cant-line-6368">side. We couldn’ t stay dry, and the water temperature was in the high thirties </span><span id="cant-line-6369">and low forties. We’d all heard the story that during the winter of 1994 it got </span><span id="cant-line-6370">so cold, four would -be Rangers died of hypothermia during Florida Phase. </span><span id="cant-line-6371">Being near the beach, freezing  my nuts off, reminded me of Hell Week. </span><span id="cant-line-6372">Whenever we stopped, guys were nut to butt and jackhammering, but as </span><span id="cant-line-6373">usual, I focused hard and refuse d to show any weakness. This time it wasn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-6374">about taking the souls of our instructors. It was about giving courage to the </span><span id="cant-line-6375">men who were struggling. I’d cross the river six times if that’s what it took </span><span id="cant-line-6376">to help one of my guys tie off his rope bridge. I’d walk them  step-by-step </span><span id="cant-line-6377">through the process until they could prove their value to the Ranger  brass. </span><span id="cant-line-6378">We slept very little, ate even less, and continually knocked off </span><span id="cant-line-6379">reconnaissance tasks, hitting waypoints, setting up bridges and weapons, andpreparing for ambush, while taking turns leading a group of fifty men. Those </span><span id="cant-line-6380">men were tired, hungry , cold, frustrated, and they did not want to be there </span><span id="cant-line-6381">anymore. Most were at their ultimate edge, their 100 percent. I was getting </span><span id="cant-line-6382">there too, but even when it wasn’t my turn to lead, I helped out because in </span><span id="cant-line-6383">those sixty -nine days of Ranger School I learned that if you want to call </span><span id="cant-line-6384">yourself a leader , that’ s what it  takes. </span><span id="cant-line-6385">A true leader stays exhausted, abhors arrogance, and never looks down on </span><span id="cant-line-6386">the weakest link. He fights for his men and leads by example. That’ s what it </span><span id="cant-line-6387">meant to be uncommon among uncommon. It meant being one of the best </span><span id="cant-line-6388">and helping your men find their best too. It was a lesson I’d wish sunk in a </span><span id="cant-line-6389">lot deeper , because in just a few more weeks I’d be challenged in the </span><span id="cant-line-6390">leadership department and come up well  short. </span><span id="cant-line-6391">Ranger School was so demanding, and the standards were so high that only </span><span id="cant-line-6392">ninety -six men graduated out of a class of 308 candidates, and the major ity </span><span id="cant-line-6393">of them were from Bravo platoon. I was awarded Enlisted Honor Man and </span><span id="cant-line-6394">received a 100 percent peer evaluation. To me that meant even more, </span><span id="cant-line-6395">because my classmates, my fellow knuckle draggers, had valued my </span><span id="cant-line-6396">leadership in harsh conditions, and one look in the mirror revealed just how </span><span id="cant-line-6397">harsh those conditions  were.Certificate for being the Enlisted Honor Man at Ranger School </span><span id="cant-line-6398">I lost fifty-six pounds in Ranger School. I looked like death. My cheeks were </span><span id="cant-line-6399">sunken. My eyes bugged out. I had no bicep muscle left. All of us were </span><span id="cant-line-6400">emaciated. Guys had trouble running down the block. Men who could do </span><span id="cant-line-6401">forty pull-ups in one go now struggled to do a single one. The Army </span><span id="cant-line-6402">expected that and scheduled three days between the end of Florida Phase and </span><span id="cant-line-6403">graduation to fatten us up before our families flew in to  celebrate. </span><span id="cant-line-6404">As soon as the final FTX was called, we hustled straight to chow  hall. I piled </span><span id="cant-line-6405">my tray with doughnuts, fries, and cheesebur gers, and went looking for the </span><span id="cant-line-6406">milk machine. After drinking all those damn chocolate shakes when I was </span><span id="cant-line-6407">down and out, my body had become lactose intolerant, and I hadn’t touched </span><span id="cant-line-6408">dairy in years. But that day I was like a little child, unable to stifle a </span><span id="cant-line-6409">primordial yearning for a glass of  milk.I found the milk machine, pulled the lever down and watched, confused, as it </span><span id="cant-line-6410">funneled out, chunky as cottage cheese. I shrugged and sniffed. It smelled all </span><span id="cant-line-6411">kinds of wrong, but I remember downing that spoiled milk like it was a fresh </span><span id="cant-line-6412">glass of sweet tea, courtesy of another hellacious special force s school that </span><span id="cant-line-6413">put us through so much, by the end anybody who survived was grateful for </span><span id="cant-line-6414">their cold glass of spoiled  milk. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6415">*** </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6416">Most people take a couple weeks off to recover from Ranger School and put </span><span id="cant-line-6417">some weight back on. Most people do that. The day of graduation, on </span><span id="cant-line-6418">Valentine’ s Day, I flew into Coronado to meet up with my second platoon. </span><span id="cant-line-6419">Once again, I looked at that lack of lag time as an oppor tunity to be </span><span id="cant-line-6420">uncommon. Not that anybody else was watching, but when it comes to </span><span id="cant-line-6421">mindset, it doesn’ t matter where  other people’ s attention lies. I had my own </span><span id="cant-line-6422">uncommon standards to live up  to. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6423">At every stop I’d made in the SEALs, from BUD/S to that first platoon to </span><span id="cant-line-6424">Ranger School, I was known as a hard motherfucker , and when the OIC in </span><span id="cant-line-6425">my second plato on put me in charge of PT, I was encouraged because it told </span><span id="cant-line-6426">me that once again I’d landed with a group of men who were driven to put </span><span id="cant-line-6427">out and get better . Inspired, I bent my brain to think of evil shit we could do </span><span id="cant-line-6428">to get us battle ready . This time we all knew we’d deploy to Iraq, and I made </span><span id="cant-line-6429">it my mission to help us become the hardest SEAL platoon in the fight. That </span><span id="cant-line-6430">was a high bar, set by the origi nal Navy SEAL legend still lodged like an </span><span id="cant-line-6431">anchor deep in my brain. Our legend suggested we were the type of men to </span><span id="cant-line-6432">swim five miles on Monday , run twenty miles on Tuesday , and climb a </span><span id="cant-line-6433">14,000- foot peak on Wednesday , and my expectations were sky fuckin g </span><span id="cant-line-6434">high. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6435">For the first week, guys rallied at 5 a.m. for a run-swim -run or a twelve -mile </span><span id="cant-line-6436">ruck, followed by a lap through the O-Course . We carried logs over the berm </span><span id="cant-line-6437">and hammered hundreds of push -ups. I had us doing the hard shit, the real </span><span id="cant-line-6438">shit, the workou ts that made us SEALs. Each day the workouts  were harder </span><span id="cant-line-6439">than the last and over the cours e of a week or two, that wore people down. </span><span id="cant-line-6440">Every alpha male in special ops wants to be the best at everything they do, </span><span id="cant-line-6441">but with me leading PT they couldn’ t always be the best. Because I nevergave them a break. We were all breaking down and showing weakness. That </span><span id="cant-line-6442">was the idea, but they didn’ t want to be challenged like that every day. </span><span id="cant-line-6443">During the second week, attendance flagged and the OIC and the Chief of </span><span id="cant-line-6444">our platoon took me  aside. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6445">“Look, dude,” our OIC said, “this is stupid. What are we  doing?” </span><span id="cant-line-6446">“We aren’ t in BUD/S anymore, Goggins,” said the  Chief. </span><span id="cant-line-6447">To me, this wasn’ t about being in BUD/S, this was about living the SEAL </span><span id="cant-line-6448">ethos and earning the Trident every day. These guys wanted to do their own </span><span id="cant-line-6449">PT, which typically meant hitting the gym and getting big. They weren’ t </span><span id="cant-line-6450">interested in being punished physically , and definitely weren’ t interested in </span><span id="cant-line-6451">being pushed to meet my stand ard. Their reaction shouldn’ t have surprised </span><span id="cant-line-6452">me, but it sure as hell disappointed me and made me lose all respect for their </span><span id="cant-line-6453">leadership. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6454">I understood that not everyone wanted to work out like an animal for the rest </span><span id="cant-line-6455">of their career , because I didn’ t want to do that shit either! But what put </span><span id="cant-line-6456">distance betwee n me and almo st everybody else in that plato on is that I </span><span id="cant-line-6457">didn’ t let my desire for comfort rule me. I was determined to go to war with </span><span id="cant-line-6458">myself to find more because I believed it was our duty to maint ain a BUD/S </span><span id="cant-line-6459">mentality and prove ourselves every day. Navy SEALs are rever ed the world </span><span id="cant-line-6460">over and are thought to be the hardest men that God ever created, but that </span><span id="cant-line-6461">conversation made me realize that wasn’ t always  true. </span><span id="cant-line-6462">I had just come from Ranger School, a place where nobody has any rank at </span><span id="cant-line-6463">all. Even if a General had classed up, he’d have been in the same clothes we </span><span id="cant-line-6464">all had to wear , that of an enlisted man on day one of basic fucking training. </span><span id="cant-line-6465">We were all maggots reborn, with no future and no past, starting at zero. I </span><span id="cant-line-6466">loved that concept because it sent a message that no matter what we’d </span><span id="cant-line-6467">accomplished in the outside world, as far as the Rangers were concerned we </span><span id="cant-line-6468">weren’ t shit. And I claimed that metaphor for myself, becaus e it’s always </span><span id="cant-line-6469">and forever true. No matter what you or I achieve, in sports, business, or life, </span><span id="cant-line-6470">we can’t be satisfied. Life is too dynamic a game. We’re either getting better </span><span id="cant-line-6471">or we’re  getting worse. Yes, we need to celebrate our victories. There’ s </span><span id="cant-line-6472">power in victory that’s transfor mative, but after our celebration we should </span><span id="cant-line-6473">dial it down, dream up new training regimens, new goals, and start at zerothe very next day. I wake up every day as if I am back in BUD/S, day one, </span><span id="cant-line-6474">week  one. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6475">Starting at zero is a mindset that says my refrigerator is never full, and it </span><span id="cant-line-6476">never will be. We can always become stronger and more agile, mentally and </span><span id="cant-line-6477">physically . We can always become more capable and more reliable. Since </span><span id="cant-line-6478">that’s the case we should never feel that our work is done. There is always </span><span id="cant-line-6479">more to  do. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6480">Are you an experienced scuba diver? Great, shed your gear, take a deep </span><span id="cant-line-6481">breath and become a one-hundred -foot free diver . Are you a badass </span><span id="cant-line-6482">triathlete? Cool, learn how to rock climb. Are you enjoyi ng a wildly </span><span id="cant-line-6483">successful career? Wonderful, learn a new language or skill. Get a second </span><span id="cant-line-6484">degree. Always be willing to embrace ignorance and become the dumb fuck </span><span id="cant-line-6485">in the classroom again, because that is the only way to expand your body of </span><span id="cant-line-6486">knowledge and body of work. It’ s the only way to expand your  mind. </span><span id="cant-line-6487">During week two of my second platoon, my Chief and OIC showed their </span><span id="cant-line-6488">cards. It was devastating to hear that they didn’ t feel that we needed to earn </span><span id="cant-line-6489">our status every day. Sure, all the guys I worked with over the years were </span><span id="cant-line-6490">relatively hard guys and highly skilled. They enjoyed the chall enges of the </span><span id="cant-line-6491">job, the brotherh ood, and being treated like superstars. They all loved being </span><span id="cant-line-6492">SEALs, but some weren’ t interested in starting at zero because just by </span><span id="cant-line-6493">qualifying to breathe rare air they were already satisfied. Now , that is a very </span><span id="cant-line-6494">common way of thinking. Most people in the world, if they ever push </span><span id="cant-line-6495">themselves at all, are willing to push themselves only so far. Once they reach </span><span id="cant-line-6496">a cushy plateau, they chill the fuck out and enjoy their reward s, but there’ s </span><span id="cant-line-6497">another phrase for that mentality . It’s called getting soft, and that I could not </span><span id="cant-line-6498">abide. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6499">As far as I was concerned I had my own reputation to uphold, and when the </span><span id="cant-line-6500">rest of the platoon opted out of my custom made hellscape, the chip on my </span><span id="cant-line-6501">shoulder grew even bigger . I ramped up my workouts and vowed to put out </span><span id="cant-line-6502">so hard it would  hurt their fucking feelings. As head of PT, that was not in </span><span id="cant-line-6503">my job description. I was suppo sed to inspire guys to give more. Instead, I </span><span id="cant-line-6504">saw what I considered a glaring weakness and let them know I wasn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-6505">impressed.In one short week, my leadersh ip regressed light years from where I was in </span><span id="cant-line-6506">Ranger School. I lost touch with my situational awareness (SA) and didn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-6507">respect the men in my platoon enough. As a leader , I was tryin g to bull my </span><span id="cant-line-6508">way through, and they bucked against that. Nobody gave an inch, including </span><span id="cant-line-6509">the officers. I suppose all of us took a path of least resistance. I just didn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-6510">notice it because physically I was going harder than  ever. </span><span id="cant-line-6511">And I had one guy with me. Sledge was a hard motherfucker who grew up in </span><span id="cant-line-6512">San Bernardino, the son of a firefighter and a secretary , and, like me, he </span><span id="cant-line-6513">taught himself to swim in order to pass the swim test and qualify for BUD/S. </span><span id="cant-line-6514">He was only a year older but was already in his fourth platoon. He was also </span><span id="cant-line-6515">a heavy drinker , a little overweight, and looking to change his life. The </span><span id="cant-line-6516">morning after the Chief, the OIC, and I had words, Sledge showed up at 5 </span><span id="cant-line-6517">a.m. ready to roll. I’d been there since 4:30 a.m. and had a lather of sweat </span><span id="cant-line-6518">working  already . </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6519">“I like what you’re doing with the workouts,” he said, “and I wanna keep </span><span id="cant-line-6520">doing  them.” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6521">“Roger  that.” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6522">From then on, no matter where we were stationed, whether that was </span><span id="cant-line-6523">Coronado, Nilan d, or Iraq, we got after it every single morning. We’d meet </span><span id="cant-line-6524">up at 4 a.m. and get to it. Sometimes that meant running up the side of a </span><span id="cant-line-6525">mountain before hitting the O-Course  at high speed and carrying logs up and </span><span id="cant-line-6526">over the berm and down the beach. In BUD/S, usually six men carried those </span><span id="cant-line-6527">logs. We did it with just the two of us. On another day we rocked a pull-up </span><span id="cant-line-6528">pyramid, hitting sets of one, all the way up to twenty , and back down to one </span><span id="cant-line-6529">again. After every other set we’d climb a rope forty feet high. One thousand </span><span id="cant-line-6530">pull-ups before breakfast became our new mantra. At first, Sledge struggled </span><span id="cant-line-6531">to rock one set of ten pull-ups. Within months he’d lost thirty -five pounds </span><span id="cant-line-6532">and was hitting one hundred sets of  ten! </span><span id="cant-line-6533">In Iraq, it was impossible to get long runs in, so we lived in the weight room. </span><span id="cant-line-6534">We did hundred s of deadlifts and spent hours on the hip sled. We went way </span><span id="cant-line-6535">beyond overtrai ning. We didn’ t care about muscle fatigue or breakdown </span><span id="cant-line-6536">because after a certain point we were training our minds, not our bodies. My </span><span id="cant-line-6537">workouts weren ’t designed to make us fast runners or to be the strongestmen on the mission. I was traini ng us to take torture so we’d remain relaxed </span><span id="cant-line-6538">in extraordinarily uncomfortable environments. And shit did get </span><span id="cant-line-6539">uncomfortable from time to  time. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6540">Despite the clear divide within our platoon (Sledge and me vs. everyone </span><span id="cant-line-6541">else) we operated well together in Iraq. Off duty, however , there  was a huge </span><span id="cant-line-6542">gulf between who the two of us were becoming and who I thought the men </span><span id="cant-line-6543">in my platoon were, and my disappointment showed. I wore my shitty </span><span id="cant-line-6544">attitude around like a shroud, thus earning me the platoon nickname David </span><span id="cant-line-6545">“Leave Me Alone” Goggins, and never woke up to realize that my </span><span id="cant-line-6546">disappointment was my own problem. Not my teammates’ fault. </span><span id="cant-line-6547">Platoon dynamics aside, there was still a job to do in Iraq </span><span id="cant-line-6548">That’ s the drawb ack of becoming uncommon amongst uncomm on. You can </span><span id="cant-line-6549">push yourself to a place that is beyond the current capability  or temporal </span><span id="cant-line-6550">mindset of the people you work with, and that’s okay . Just know that yoursupposed superiority is a figment of your own ego. So don’t lord it over </span><span id="cant-line-6551">them, because it won’ t help you advance as a team or as an individual in </span><span id="cant-line-6552">your field. Inste ad of getting angry that your colleagues can’t keep up, help </span><span id="cant-line-6553">pick your colleagues up and bring them with  you! </span><span id="cant-line-6554">We are all fighting the same battle. All of us are torn between comfort and </span><span id="cant-line-6555">performance, between settling for mediocrity or being willing  to suffer in </span><span id="cant-line-6556">order to become  our best self, all the damn time. We make those kinds of </span><span id="cant-line-6557">decisions a dozen or more times each day. My job as head of PT wasn’ t to </span><span id="cant-line-6558">demand that my guys live up to the Navy SEAL legend  I loved, it was to </span><span id="cant-line-6559">help them become the best version of themselves. But I never listened, and I </span><span id="cant-line-6560">didn’ t lead. Instead, I got angry and showed up my teammates. For two years </span><span id="cant-line-6561">I played  the tough guy and never took a step back with a calm mind to </span><span id="cant-line-6562">address my original error . I had countless opportunities to bridg e the gap I’d </span><span id="cant-line-6563">helped create, but I never did, and it cost  me. </span><span id="cant-line-6564">I didn’t realize any of that right away , because after my second platoon, I </span><span id="cant-line-6565">was ordered to freefall school, then made an assaults instructor . Both were </span><span id="cant-line-6566">posts scheduled to prep me for Green Team. Assaults was critical because </span><span id="cant-line-6567">most people who get cut from Green Team are dismissed for sloppy house </span><span id="cant-line-6568">runs. They move too slow when  clearing buildings, are too easily exposed, </span><span id="cant-line-6569">or are amped up and trigger happy and end up shooting friendly targets. </span><span id="cant-line-6570">Teaching those skills made me clinical, stealthy , and calm in confined </span><span id="cant-line-6571">environments, and I expected to receive my orders to train with DEVGRU in </span><span id="cant-line-6572">Dam Neck, Virginia, any day, but they never came. The other two guys </span><span id="cant-line-6573">who’d rocked the screening with me received their orders. Mine went </span><span id="cant-line-6574">AWOL. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6575">I called leadership at Dam Neck. They told me to screen again, and that’s </span><span id="cant-line-6576">when I knew something was off. I thought about the process I’d been </span><span id="cant-line-6577">through. Did I really expect to do better? I smoked that shit. But then I </span><span id="cant-line-6578">remembered the actual interview , which felt more like an interrogation with </span><span id="cant-line-6579">two men playing good cop, bad cop. They didn’ t probe my skillset or Navy </span><span id="cant-line-6580">knowhow . Eighty -five percent  of their questions had nothing to do with my </span><span id="cant-line-6581">ability to operate whatsoever . The bulk of that interview was about my  race. </span><span id="cant-line-6582">“We are a bunch of good ol’ boys,” one of them said, “and we need to know </span><span id="cant-line-6583">how you’re gonna handle hearing black jokes, bro.”Most of their questions were a variation on that one theme and through it all, </span><span id="cant-line-6584">I smiled and thought, How are you white boys gonna feel when I’m the </span><span id="cant-line-6585">baddest mother fucker in here? But that’s not what I said, and it wasn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-6586">because I was intimidated or uncomfortable. I was more at home in that </span><span id="cant-line-6587">interview than anywhere I’d been in the military , because for the first time in </span><span id="cant-line-6588">my life it was out in the fuckin g open. They weren’ t trying to pretend that </span><span id="cant-line-6589">being one of only a handful of black guys in perhaps the most revered </span><span id="cant-line-6590">military organization in the world didn’ t have its own unique set of </span><span id="cant-line-6591">challenges. One guy was challenging me with his aggressive posture and </span><span id="cant-line-6592">tone, the other guy kept it cool, but they were both being real. There were </span><span id="cant-line-6593">two or three black men in DEVGRU already and they were telling me that </span><span id="cant-line-6594">entry into their inner circle required my signing off on certain terms and </span><span id="cant-line-6595">conditions. And in a sick way, I loved that message and the challenge that </span><span id="cant-line-6596">came with  it. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6597">DEVGRU was a hard ass, renegade crew within the SEALs, and they </span><span id="cant-line-6598">wanted it to stay that way. They  didn’ t want to civilize anybody . They didn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-6599">want to evolve or change, and I knew where I was and what I was getting </span><span id="cant-line-6600">myself into. This crew was responsible for the most dangerous, tip of the </span><span id="cant-line-6601">spear missions. It was a white man’ s underworld, and these guys needed to </span><span id="cant-line-6602">know how I’d act if someone started to fuck with me. They needed </span><span id="cant-line-6603">assurances I could control my emotions, and once I saw through their </span><span id="cant-line-6604">language into the greater purpose, I couldn’ t be of fended by their  act. </span><span id="cant-line-6605">“Look, I’ve experienced racism my entire life,” I replied, “and there is </span><span id="cant-line-6606">nothing any of you fuckers can say to me that I haven’ t heard twenty times </span><span id="cant-line-6607">before, but be ready. Because I’m coming right the fuck back at you!” At the </span><span id="cant-line-6608">time, they seemed to like the sound of that. Trouble is, when you’re a black </span><span id="cant-line-6609">guy giving it back it usually doesn’ t go over nearly as  well. </span><span id="cant-line-6610">I will never know why I didn’ t receive my orders for Green Team, and it </span><span id="cant-line-6611">doesn’ t matter . We can’t control  all the variables in our lives. It’s about what </span><span id="cant-line-6612">we do with opportunities revok ed or presented to us that determine how a </span><span id="cant-line-6613">story ends. Instead of thinking, I crushed the screening process once, I can </span><span id="cant-line-6614">do it again,  I decide d to start at zero and screen for Delta Force—the Army’ s </span><span id="cant-line-6615">version of DEVGRU, instead.Delta Selection is rigorous, and I’d always been intrigued by it due to the </span><span id="cant-line-6616">elusive nature of the group. Unlike SEALs, you never heard about Delta. </span><span id="cant-line-6617">The screening for Delta Selection included an IQ test, a complete military </span><span id="cant-line-6618">resume including my qualificati ons and war experience, and my evaluations. </span><span id="cant-line-6619">I pulled  all of that together in a few days, knowing that I was competing </span><span id="cant-line-6620">against the best guys from every military branch and that only the cream </span><span id="cant-line-6621">would be extended an invitation. My Delta orders came through in a matter </span><span id="cant-line-6622">of weeks. Not long after that, I landed in the mountains of West Virginia </span><span id="cant-line-6623">ready to compete for a spot among the Army’ s very best  soldiers. </span><span id="cant-line-6624">Strangely , there was no yelling or screaming in the Delta void. There was no </span><span id="cant-line-6625">muster and no OICs. The men that showed up there were all self-starters  and </span><span id="cant-line-6626">our orders were chalked on a board hanging in the barracks. For three days </span><span id="cant-line-6627">we weren’ t allowed to leave the compound. Our focus was rest and </span><span id="cant-line-6628">acclimatization, but on day four, PT started up with the basic screening test, </span><span id="cant-line-6629">which included two minutes of push -ups, two minutes of sit-ups, and a timed </span><span id="cant-line-6630">two-mile run. They expected everyone to meet a minimum standard, and </span><span id="cant-line-6631">those that didn’ t were sent home. From there things got immediately and </span><span id="cant-line-6632">progressively more difficult. In fact, later that same night we had our first </span><span id="cant-line-6633">road march. Like everything in Delta, officially the distance was unknown, </span><span id="cant-line-6634">but I believe it was about an eighteen -mile course from start to  finish. </span><span id="cant-line-6635">It was cold and very dark when all 160 of us took off, strapped with around </span><span id="cant-line-6636">forty -pound  rucksacks. Most guys started out in a slow march, content to </span><span id="cant-line-6637">pace themselves  and hike it out. I took off hot, and in the first quarter mile </span><span id="cant-line-6638">left everyone behind. I saw an opportunity to be uncommon and seized it, </span><span id="cant-line-6639">and I finished about thirty minutes before anybody  else. </span><span id="cant-line-6640">Delta Selection is the best orienteering course in the world. For the next ten </span><span id="cant-line-6641">days we hammered PT in the morning and worked on advanced land </span><span id="cant-line-6642">navigation skills into the night. They taught us how to get from  A to B by </span><span id="cant-line-6643">reading the terrain instead of roads and trails on a map. We learned to read </span><span id="cant-line-6644">fingers and cuts, and that if you get high you want to stay high. We were </span><span id="cant-line-6645">taught to follow water . When you start reading the land this way, your map </span><span id="cant-line-6646">comes alive, and for the first time in my life I became great at orienteering. </span><span id="cant-line-6647">We learned to judge distance and how to draw our own topographic maps. </span><span id="cant-line-6648">At first we were assigned an instructor to tail through the wildlands, and </span><span id="cant-line-6649">those instructors  hauled ass. For the next few weeks we were on our own.Technically , we were still practicing, but we were also being  graded and </span><span id="cant-line-6650">watched to make sure we were moving cross -country  instead of taking  roads. </span><span id="cant-line-6651">It all culminated with an extended final exam in the field that lasted seven </span><span id="cant-line-6652">days and nights, if we even made it that far. This wasn’ t a team effort. Each </span><span id="cant-line-6653">of us was on our own to use our map and compass to naviga te from one </span><span id="cant-line-6654">waypoint to the next. There was a Humvee at every stop and the cadres (our </span><span id="cant-line-6655">instructors and evaluators) there noted our time and gave us the next set of </span><span id="cant-line-6656">coordinates. Each day was its own unique challenge, and we never knew </span><span id="cant-line-6657">how many points we’d have to navigate before the test was done. Plus, there </span><span id="cant-line-6658">was an unknown time limit that only the cadres were privy to. At the finish </span><span id="cant-line-6659">line we weren’ t told if we passe d or failed. Instead we were directed to one </span><span id="cant-line-6660">of two covered Humvees. The good truck took you to the next camp, the bad </span><span id="cant-line-6661">truck motored back to base, where you would have to pack your shit and </span><span id="cant-line-6662">head home. Most of the time I didn’ t know if I made it for sure until the </span><span id="cant-line-6663">truck  stopped. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6664">By day five I was one of rough ly thirty guys still in consideration for Delta </span><span id="cant-line-6665">Force. There were only three days left and I was rocking every test, coming </span><span id="cant-line-6666">in at least ninety -minutes  before drop-dead  time. The final test would be a </span><span id="cant-line-6667">forty -mile ball-kicker  of a land navigation, and I was looking forward to </span><span id="cant-line-6668">that, but first I had work to do. I splashed through washes, huffed up sloped </span><span id="cant-line-6669">woodlands, and rambled along ridgelines, point -to-point  until the </span><span id="cant-line-6670">unthinkable happened. I got lost. I was on the wrong ridge. I double checked </span><span id="cant-line-6671">my map and compass and looked across a valley to the correct one, due </span><span id="cant-line-6672">south. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6673">Roger  that! </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6674">For the first time, the clock became a factor . I didn’ t know the drop-dead </span><span id="cant-line-6675">time, but knew I was cutting it close, so I sprinted down a steep ravine but </span><span id="cant-line-6676">lost my footing. My left foot jammed between two boulders, I rolled over </span><span id="cant-line-6677">my ankle and felt it pop. The pain was immediate. I checked  my watch, </span><span id="cant-line-6678">gritted my teeth, and laced my boot tight as quickly as I could, then hobbled </span><span id="cant-line-6679">up a steep hillside to the correct  ridge. </span><span id="cant-line-6680">On the final stretch to the finish , my ankle blew up so bad I had to untie my </span><span id="cant-line-6681">boot to relieve the pain. I moved slow, convinced I would be sent home. Iwas wrong. My Humvee unloa ded us at the second to last base camp of </span><span id="cant-line-6682">Delta Selection, where I iced my ankle all night knowing that thanks to my </span><span id="cant-line-6683">injury , the next day’s land navigation test was likely beyond my capability . </span><span id="cant-line-6684">But I didn’ t quit. I showed up, fought to stay in the mix, but missed my time </span><span id="cant-line-6685">on one of the early checkpoints  and that was that. I didn’ t hang my head, </span><span id="cant-line-6686">because injuries  happen. I’d given it everything I had and when you handle </span><span id="cant-line-6687">business like that, your ef fort will not go  unnoticed. </span><span id="cant-line-6688">Delta cadres are like robots. Throughout Selection they didn’ t show any </span><span id="cant-line-6689">personality , but as I was gettin g ready to leave the compound , one of the </span><span id="cant-line-6690">officers in char ge called me into his  office. </span><span id="cant-line-6691">“Goggins,” he said, extending his hand, “you are a stud! We want you to </span><span id="cant-line-6692">heal up, come back, and try again. We believe you will be a great addition to </span><span id="cant-line-6693">Delta Force  someday .” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6694">But when? I came to from my second heart surgery in a billow ing cloud of </span><span id="cant-line-6695">anesthesia. I looked over my right shoulder to an IV drip and followed the </span><span id="cant-line-6696">flow to my veins. I was wired to the medical mind. Beeping heart monitors </span><span id="cant-line-6697">recorded data to tell a story in a language beyond my comprehension. If only </span><span id="cant-line-6698">I were fluent, maybe I’d know if my heart was finally whole, if there would </span><span id="cant-line-6699">ever be a “someday .” I placed my hand over my heart, closed my eyes and </span><span id="cant-line-6700">listened for  clues. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6701">After leaving Delta, I went back to the SEAL Teams and was assigned to </span><span id="cant-line-6702">land warfare as an instructor instead of a warrior . At first my morale flagged. </span><span id="cant-line-6703">Men who lacked  my skills, comm itment, and athletic ability were in the field </span><span id="cant-line-6704">in two countries and I was moored in no-man’s-land, wondering how it had </span><span id="cant-line-6705">all gone so haywire so quickly . It felt like I’d hit a glass ceiling, but had it </span><span id="cant-line-6706">always been there or did I slide it into place myself? The truth was </span><span id="cant-line-6707">somewhere in  between. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6708">I realize d from living in Brazil, Indiana, that prejudice is everywhere. There </span><span id="cant-line-6709">is a piece of it in every person and each and every organization, and if you </span><span id="cant-line-6710">are the only  in any given situation, it’s on you to decide how you’re going to </span><span id="cant-line-6711">handle it because you can’t make it go away . For years, I used it to fuel me </span><span id="cant-line-6712">because there’ s a lot of power in being the only. It force s you to juice your </span><span id="cant-line-6713">own resources and to believe in yourself in the face of unfair scrutiny . Itincreases the degree of difficulty , which makes every success that much </span><span id="cant-line-6714">sweeter . That’ s why I continually put myself in situations where I knew I </span><span id="cant-line-6715">would encounter it. I fed off being the only  one in a room. I brought the war </span><span id="cant-line-6716">to people and watched my excellence explode small minds. I didn’ t sit back </span><span id="cant-line-6717">and cry about being the only. I took action, said go fuck yourself, and used </span><span id="cant-line-6718">all the prejudice I felt as dynamite to blow up those  walls. </span><span id="cant-line-6719">But that kind of raw material will only get you so far in life. I was so </span><span id="cant-line-6720">confrontational I created needless enemies along the way , and I believe that’ s </span><span id="cant-line-6721">what limited my access to the top SEAL Teams. With my career at a </span><span id="cant-line-6722">crossroads, I didn’ t have time to dwell on those mistakes. I had to find </span><span id="cant-line-6723">higher ground and turn the nega tive I’d created into another positive. I didn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-6724">just accept land warfare duty, I was the best instructor I could possibly be, </span><span id="cant-line-6725">and on my own time I created new opportunities for myself by launching my </span><span id="cant-line-6726">ultra quest, which revived my stalled career . I was right back on track until I </span><span id="cant-line-6727">learned I’d been born with a broken  heart. </span><span id="cant-line-6728">Yet there was a positive side to that too. Tucked into my post-op hospital </span><span id="cant-line-6729">bed, I looked to be fading in and out of consciousness, as conversations </span><span id="cant-line-6730">between doctors, nurses, my wife, and mother bled into one another like </span><span id="cant-line-6731">white noise. They had no clue that I was wide awake the whole time, </span><span id="cant-line-6732">listening to my wounded heart beat, and smiling inside. Knowing I finally </span><span id="cant-line-6733">had definitive, scientific proof that I was as uncommon as any motherfucker </span><span id="cant-line-6734">who has ever  lived.CHALLENGE #9 </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6735">This one’s for the unusual motherfuckers in this world. A lot of people </span><span id="cant-line-6736">think that once they reach a certain level of status, respect, or success, that </span><span id="cant-line-6737">they’ve made it in life. I’m here to tell you that you always have to find </span><span id="cant-line-6738">more. Greatness is not something that if you meet it once it stays with you </span><span id="cant-line-6739">forever . That shit evaporates like a flash of oil in a hot  pan. </span><span id="cant-line-6740">If you truly want to become uncommon amongst the uncommon, it will </span><span id="cant-line-6741">require sustaining greatness for a long period of time. It requires staying in </span><span id="cant-line-6742">constant pursuit and putting out unending effort. This may sound appealing </span><span id="cant-line-6743">but will require everything you have to give and then some. Believe me, </span><span id="cant-line-6744">this is not for everyone becaus e it will demand singular focus and may </span><span id="cant-line-6745">upset the balance in your  life. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6746">That’ s what it takes to become a true overachiever , and if you are already </span><span id="cant-line-6747">surrounded by people who are at the top of their game, what are you going </span><span id="cant-line-6748">to do differently to stand out? It’s easy to stand out among st everyday </span><span id="cant-line-6749">people and be a big fish in a small pond. It is a much more difficult task </span><span id="cant-line-6750">when you are a wolf surrounded by  wolves. </span><span id="cant-line-6751">This means not only getting into Wharton Business School , but being </span><span id="cant-line-6752">ranked #1 in your class. It mean s not just graduating BUD/S, but becoming </span><span id="cant-line-6753">Enlisted Honor Man in Army Ranger School then going out and finishing </span><span id="cant-line-6754">Badwater . </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6755">Torch the complacency you feel gathering around you, your coworkers, and </span><span id="cant-line-6756">teammates in that rare air. Continue to put obstacles in front of yourself, </span><span id="cant-line-6757">because that’s where you’ll find the friction that will help you grow even </span><span id="cant-line-6758">stronger . Before you know it, you will stand  alone. </span><span id="cant-line-6759">#canthurtme #uncommonamongstuncommon.CHAPTER TEN </span><span id="cant-line-6760">10. THE EMPOWERMENT OF </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6761">FAILURE </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6762">ON S EPTEMBER  27, 2012, I STOOD  IN  A  MAKESHIFT  GYM  ON  THE  SECOND  FLOOR  OF </span><span id="cant-line-6763">30 Rock efeller Center prepared  to break the world record for pull-ups in a </span><span id="cant-line-6764">twenty-four -hour period. That was the plan, anyway . Savannah Guthrie was </span><span id="cant-line-6765">there, along with an official from  the Guinness Book of World Records and </span><span id="cant-line-6766">Matt Lauer (yeah, that fucking guy). Again, I was gunning to raise money— </span><span id="cant-line-6767">a lot of money this time—for the Special Operations Warrior Foundation, </span><span id="cant-line-6768">but I also wanted that record. To get it I had to perform under The Today </span><span id="cant-line-6769">Show  spotlight. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6770">The number in my head was 4,020 pull-ups. Sounds superhuman, right? Did </span><span id="cant-line-6771">to me too, until I dissected it and realized if I could knock out six pull-ups on </span><span id="cant-line-6772">the minute, every minute, for twenty -four hours, I’d shatter it. That’ s roughly </span><span id="cant-line-6773">ten seconds of effort, and fifty seconds of rest, each minute. It wouldn’ t be </span><span id="cant-line-6774">easy, but I considered it doable given the work I’d put in. Over the past five </span><span id="cant-line-6775">to six months, I’d rocked over 40,000 pull-ups and was stoked to be on the </span><span id="cant-line-6776">precipice of another huge challe nge. After all the ups and downs since my </span><span id="cant-line-6777">second heart sur gery, I needed  this. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6778">The good news was the surgery worked. For the first time in my life I had a </span><span id="cant-line-6779">fully functioning heart muscle, and I wasn’ t in a rush to run or ride. I was </span><span id="cant-line-6780">patient with my recovery . The Navy wouldn’ t clear me to operate anyway , </span><span id="cant-line-6781">and in order to stay in the SEA Ls I had to accept a non-deployable , non- </span><span id="cant-line-6782">combat  job. Admiral Winters kept me in recruiting for two more years, and I </span><span id="cant-line-6783">remained on the road, shared my story with willing ears, and worked to win </span><span id="cant-line-6784">hearts and minds. But all I really wanted to do was what I was trained to do,and that’s fight!  I tried to salve that wound with trips to the gun range, but </span><span id="cant-line-6785">shooting tar gets only made me feel  worse. </span><span id="cant-line-6786">In 2011, after recruiting for four-plus years and spending two and a half </span><span id="cant-line-6787">years on the disabled list due to my heart issues, I was finally medically </span><span id="cant-line-6788">cleared to operate again. Admiral Winters offered to send me anywhere I </span><span id="cant-line-6789">wanted to go. He knew my sacrifices and my dreams, and I told him I had </span><span id="cant-line-6790">unfinished business with Delta. He signed my papers, and after a five-year </span><span id="cant-line-6791">wait, my someday had  arrived. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6792">Awarded the Meritorious Service Medal for my work in recruitingChosen as Sailor of the Quarter , January to March 2010 </span><span id="cant-line-6793">Once again, I dropped into Appalachia for Delta Selection. In 2006, after I </span><span id="cant-line-6794">smoked the eighteen -mile road ruck on our first real day of work, I heard </span><span id="cant-line-6795">some well-intentioned  blowback from some of the other guys who were </span><span id="cant-line-6796">tapped into the rumor mill. In Delta Selection everything is a secret. Yes, </span><span id="cant-line-6797">there are clear tasks and training  but nobody tells you how long the tasks are </span><span id="cant-line-6798">or will be (even the eighteen -mile ruck was a best estimate based on my own </span><span id="cant-line-6799">navigation), and only the cadres know how they evaluate their candidates. </span><span id="cant-line-6800">According to the rumor mill, they use that first ruck as a baseline to calculate </span><span id="cant-line-6801">how long each navigation task should take. Meaning if you go hard you’ll </span><span id="cant-line-6802">eat away  at your own margin for error . This time, I had that intel going in, </span><span id="cant-line-6803">and I could have played it safe and taken my time, but I wasn’ t about to goout among those great men and give a half-assed  effort. I went out even </span><span id="cant-line-6804">harder so I could make sure they saw my very best, and I broke my own </span><span id="cant-line-6805">course record (according to that reliable rumor mill) by nine  minutes. </span><span id="cant-line-6806">Rather than hear it from me, I reached out to one of the guys who was in </span><span id="cant-line-6807">Delta Selection with me, and below is his first-hand  account of how that </span><span id="cant-line-6808">ruck went  down: </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6809">Before I can talk about the road march, I have to give a little bit of </span><span id="cant-line-6810">context in the days leading up to it. Showing up to Selection you have no </span><span id="cant-line-6811">idea what to expect, everyone hears stories but you do not have a </span><span id="cant-line-6812">complete grasp of what you are about to go through…I remember </span><span id="cant-line-6813">arriving at an airport waiting for a bus and everyone was hanging out </span><span id="cant-line-6814">bullshitting. For many people it is a reunion of friends that you haven’ t </span><span id="cant-line-6815">seen in years. This is also where you start sizing everyone up. I </span><span id="cant-line-6816">remember a majority of the people talking or relaxing, there was one </span><span id="cant-line-6817">person who was sitting on his bag, looking intense. That person I would </span><span id="cant-line-6818">later find out was David Goggins, you could tell right from the start he </span><span id="cant-line-6819">would be one of the guys at the end. Being a runner , I recognized him, </span><span id="cant-line-6820">but didn’ t really put it all together until after the first few  days. </span><span id="cant-line-6821">There are several events that you know you have to do just to start the </span><span id="cant-line-6822">course; one of those is the road march. W ithout getting into specific </span><span id="cant-line-6823">distances, I knew it was going to be fairly far but was comfortable with </span><span id="cant-line-6824">running a majority of it. Coming into Selection, I had been in Special </span><span id="cant-line-6825">Forces for a majority of my career and it was rare when someone </span><span id="cant-line-6826">finished before me in a road march. I was comfortable with a ruck on my </span><span id="cant-line-6827">back. When we started it was a little cold and very dark, and as we took </span><span id="cant-line-6828">off I was where I was most comfortable, out front. W ithin the first </span><span id="cant-line-6829">quarter mile a guy blew by me, I thought to myself, “No way he could </span><span id="cant-line-6830">keep that pace.” But I could see the light on his headlamp continue to </span><span id="cant-line-6831">pull away; I figured I would see him in a few miles after the course </span><span id="cant-line-6832">crushed  him. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6833">This particular road march course has a reputation of being brutal; there </span><span id="cant-line-6834">was one hill that as I was going up I could almost reach out in front of </span><span id="cant-line-6835">me and touch the ground, it was that steep. At this point, there was only </span><span id="cant-line-6836">one guy in front of me and I saw footprints that were twice as long as mystride length. I was in awe, my exact thought was, “This is the craziest </span><span id="cant-line-6837">shit I have seen; that dude ran up this hill.” Throughout the next couple </span><span id="cant-line-6838">of hours, I was expecting to come around a corner and find him laid up </span><span id="cant-line-6839">on the side of the road, but that never happened. Once finished, I was </span><span id="cant-line-6840">laying out my gear and I saw David hanging out. He had been done for </span><span id="cant-line-6841">quite a while. Though Selection is an individual event, he was the first to </span><span id="cant-line-6842">give a high five and say , “Nice  work.” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6843">—T, in an email dated 06/25/2018 </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6844">That performance left an impression beyond the guys in my Selection class. </span><span id="cant-line-6845">I heard recently from Hawk, another SEAL, that some Army guys he worked </span><span id="cant-line-6846">with on deploym ent were still talking about that ruck, almost like it is an </span><span id="cant-line-6847">urban legend. From there I continued to smash through Delta Selection at or </span><span id="cant-line-6848">near the top of the class. My land navigation skills were better than they’d </span><span id="cant-line-6849">ever been, but that doesn’ t mean it was easy. Roads were off limits, there </span><span id="cant-line-6850">was no flat ground, and for days we bushwhacked up and down steep slopes, </span><span id="cant-line-6851">in below -freezing  temperatures, taking waypoint s, reading maps, and the </span><span id="cant-line-6852">countless peaks, ridges, and draws that all looked the same. We moved </span><span id="cant-line-6853">through thick brush and deep snow banks, splashed through icy creeks, and </span><span id="cant-line-6854">slalomed the winter skeletons of towering trees. It was painful,  challenging, </span><span id="cant-line-6855">and fucking beautiful, and I was smoking it, mashing every test they could </span><span id="cant-line-6856">conjure. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6857">On the second to last day of Delta Selection, I hit my first four points as fast </span><span id="cant-line-6858">as usual. Most days there were five waypoints to hit in total, so when I got </span><span id="cant-line-6859">my fifth I was beyond confident . In my mind, I was the black Daniel Boone. </span><span id="cant-line-6860">I plotted my point and moseyed down another steep grade. One way to </span><span id="cant-line-6861">navigate foreign terrain is to track power lines, and I could see that one of </span><span id="cant-line-6862">those lines in the distance led directly to my fifth, and final point. I hustled </span><span id="cant-line-6863">down country , tracked the line, turned my conscious mind off, and started </span><span id="cant-line-6864">dreaming ahead.  I knew I was going to rock the final exam—th at forty -mile </span><span id="cant-line-6865">land navigation I didn’ t even get to attempt last time because I busted my </span><span id="cant-line-6866">ankle two days before. I considered my graduation a foregone conclusion, </span><span id="cant-line-6867">and after that I’d be running and gunning in an elite unit again. As I </span><span id="cant-line-6868">visualized it, it became all the more real, and my imagination  took me far </span><span id="cant-line-6869">away from the Appalachian  Mountains.The thing about following the power supply is you’d better make damn sure </span><span id="cant-line-6870">you’re on the right line! Accor ding to my training, I was supposed to be </span><span id="cant-line-6871">constantly checking my map, so if I made a misstep I could re-adjust  and </span><span id="cant-line-6872">head in the right direction without losing too much time, but I was so </span><span id="cant-line-6873">overconfident I forgot to do that, and I didn’ t chart backstops either . By the </span><span id="cant-line-6874">time I woke from fantasy land, I was way off course and almost out of </span><span id="cant-line-6875">bounds! </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6876">I went into panic mode, found my location on the map, humped it to the </span><span id="cant-line-6877">right power line, sprinted to the top of the mountain and kept running all the </span><span id="cant-line-6878">way to my fifth point. I still had ninety minutes until drop-dead  time but </span><span id="cant-line-6879">when I got close  to the next Humvee I saw another guy heading  back toward </span><span id="cant-line-6880">me! </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6881">“Where you headed,” I asked as I jogged  over. </span><span id="cant-line-6882">“I’m of f to my sixth point,” he  said. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6883">“Shit, there’ s not five points  today?!” </span><span id="cant-line-6884">“Nah, there’ s six today , brother .” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6885">I checked my watch. I had a little over forty minutes before they called time. </span><span id="cant-line-6886">I reached the Humvee, took down the coordinates for checkp oint six and </span><span id="cant-line-6887">studied the map. Thanks to my fuck up, I had two clear options. I could play </span><span id="cant-line-6888">by the rules and miss drop-dead  time or I could break the rules, use the roads </span><span id="cant-line-6889">at my disposal, and give myself a chance. The one thing on my side was that </span><span id="cant-line-6890">in speci al opera tions they prize a thinking shooter , a soldier willing to do </span><span id="cant-line-6891">what it takes to meet an objective. All I could do was hope they’d have </span><span id="cant-line-6892">mercy on me. I plotted the best possible route and took the fuck off. I skirted </span><span id="cant-line-6893">the woods, used the roads, and whenever I heard a truck rumbling in the near </span><span id="cant-line-6894">distance, I took cover . A half hour later, at the crest of yet another mountain, </span><span id="cant-line-6895">I could see the sixth point, our finish line. According to my watc h, I had five </span><span id="cant-line-6896">minutes  left. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6897">I flew downhill, sprinting all out, and made drop-dead  by one minute. As I </span><span id="cant-line-6898">caught my breath, our crew was divided and loaded into the covered beds of </span><span id="cant-line-6899">two separate Humvees. At first glance, my group of guys looked prettysquared away , but given when and where I received my sixth point, every </span><span id="cant-line-6900">cadre in the place had to know  I’d skirted protocol. I didn’ t know what to </span><span id="cant-line-6901">think. W as I still in or assed  out? </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6902">At Delta Selection, one way to be sure you’re out is if you feel speed bumps </span><span id="cant-line-6903">after a day’s work. Speed bump s mean you’re back at the base, and you’re </span><span id="cant-line-6904">heading home early . That day, when we felt the first one jar us out of our </span><span id="cant-line-6905">hopes and dreams, some guys started cursing, others had tears in their eyes. I </span><span id="cant-line-6906">just shook my  head. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6907">“Goggins, what  the fuck are you doing here?” One guy asked. He was </span><span id="cant-line-6908">shocked to see me sitting along side him, but I was resigned to my reality </span><span id="cant-line-6909">because I’d been daydreaming about graduating Delta training and being a </span><span id="cant-line-6910">part of the force when I hadn’ t even finished  Selection! </span><span id="cant-line-6911">“I didn’ t do what they told me to do,” I said. “I fucking deserve to go  home.” </span><span id="cant-line-6912">“Bullshit! You are one of the best guys out here. They’re making a huge </span><span id="cant-line-6913">mistake.” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6914">I appreciated his outrage. I expe cted to make it too, but I could n’t be upset </span><span id="cant-line-6915">by their decisio n. Delta brass weren’ t looking for men who could pass a </span><span id="cant-line-6916">class with a C, B+, or even an A- effort. They only accepted A+ students, </span><span id="cant-line-6917">and if you fucked up and delivered a performance that was below your </span><span id="cant-line-6918">capability they sent you packing. Shit, if you daydream for a split second on </span><span id="cant-line-6919">the battlefield, that could mean your life and the life of one of your brothers. </span><span id="cant-line-6920">I understood  that. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6921">“No. It was my mistake,” I said. “I got this far by staying focused and </span><span id="cant-line-6922">delivering my best, and I’m going home because I lost  focus.” </span><span id="cant-line-6923">*** </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6924">It was time to go back to being  a SEAL. For the next two years I based in </span><span id="cant-line-6925">Honolulu as part of a clandestine transport unit called SDV, for SEAL </span><span id="cant-line-6926">Delivery Vehicl es. Operation Red Wings is the best known SDV mission, </span><span id="cant-line-6927">and you only heard about it because it was such big news. Most SDV work </span><span id="cant-line-6928">happens in the shadows, and well out of sight. I fit in well over there, and itwas great to be back operating again. I lived on Ford Island, with a view of </span><span id="cant-line-6929">Pearl Harbor right out my living room window . Kate and I had split up, so </span><span id="cant-line-6930">now I was really living that Spartan life, and still waking up at 5 a.m. to run </span><span id="cant-line-6931">into work. I had two routes, an eight -miler  and a ten-miler , but no matter </span><span id="cant-line-6932">which I took my body didn’ t react too well. After only a few miles, I’d feel </span><span id="cant-line-6933">intense neck pain and dizzy spells. There were several times during my runs </span><span id="cant-line-6934">that I would have to sit down due to  vertigo. </span><span id="cant-line-6935">For years I’d harbored a suspic ion that we all had a limit on the miles we </span><span id="cant-line-6936">could run before a full-body  breakdown, and I wondered if I was closing in </span><span id="cant-line-6937">on mine . My body had never felt so tight. I had a knot on the base of my </span><span id="cant-line-6938">skull that I first noticed after graduating BUD/S. A decade later it had </span><span id="cant-line-6939">doubled in size. I had knots above my hip flexors too. I went to the doctor to </span><span id="cant-line-6940">get everything checked out, but they weren’ t even tumors, much less </span><span id="cant-line-6941">malignant. When  the doctors cleared me of mortal danger , I realized I’d have </span><span id="cant-line-6942">to live with them and try to for get about long-distance  running for a  while. </span><span id="cant-line-6943">When an activity or exercise that you’ve always relied on gets taken away </span><span id="cant-line-6944">from you, like running was for me, it’s easy to get stuck in a mental rut and </span><span id="cant-line-6945">stop doing any exercise at all, but I didn’ t have a quitter ’s mentality . I </span><span id="cant-line-6946">gravitated towar d the pull-up bar and replicated the workou ts I used to do </span><span id="cant-line-6947">with Sledge. It was an exercise  that allowed me to push myself and didn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-6948">make me dizzy because I could take a break between sets. After a while I </span><span id="cant-line-6949">Googled around to see if there was a pull-up record within reach. That’ s </span><span id="cant-line-6950">when I read about Stephen Hyland’ s many pull-up records , includ ing the </span><span id="cant-line-6951">twenty -four-hour record of 4,020. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6952">At the time I was known as an ultra runner , and I didn’ t want to be known </span><span id="cant-line-6953">for just one thing. Who does? Nobody thought of me as an all-around </span><span id="cant-line-6954">athlete, and this record could change that dynamic. How many people are </span><span id="cant-line-6955">capable of running 100, 150, even 200 miles and also knocking out over </span><span id="cant-line-6956">4,000 pull-ups in a day? I called the Special Operations Warrior Foundation </span><span id="cant-line-6957">and asked if I could help raise a bit more money . They were thrilled, and </span><span id="cant-line-6958">next thing I knew , a contact of mine used her networking skills to book me </span><span id="cant-line-6959">on the damn Today  Show . </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6960">To prepare for the attempt I did 400 pull-ups a day during the week, which </span><span id="cant-line-6961">took me about seventy minutes. On Saturday I did 1,500 pull-ups, in sets offive to ten reps over three hours, and on Sunday I dialed it back to 750. All </span><span id="cant-line-6962">that work strengthened my lats, triceps, biceps, and back, prepared my </span><span id="cant-line-6963">shoulder and elbow joints to take extreme punishment, helped me develop a </span><span id="cant-line-6964">powerful gorilla -type grip, and built up my lactic acid tolerance so my </span><span id="cant-line-6965">muscles could still function long after they were overworked. As game day </span><span id="cant-line-6966">approached, I shortened recovery and started doing five pull-ups every thirty </span><span id="cant-line-6967">seconds for two hours. After ward my arms fell to my side, limp as </span><span id="cant-line-6968">overstretched rubber  bands. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6969">On the eve of my record attempt, my mom and uncle flew into New York </span><span id="cant-line-6970">City to help crew me, and we were all systems go until the SEALs nearly </span><span id="cant-line-6971">killed my Today Show  appearance at the last minute. No Easy Day, a first- </span><span id="cant-line-6972">hand  account of the Osama Bin Laden raid, had just come out. It was written </span><span id="cant-line-6973">by one of the operators in the DEVGRU unit that got it done , and Naval </span><span id="cant-line-6974">Special Warfare  brass were not happy . Special Operators are not supposed to </span><span id="cant-line-6975">share details of the work we do in the field with the general public, and lots </span><span id="cant-line-6976">of people in the Teams resented that book. I was given a direct order to pull </span><span id="cant-line-6977">out of the appearance, which didn’ t make any sense. I wasn’ t going on </span><span id="cant-line-6978">camera to talk about operations,  and I wasn’ t on a mission to self-promote . I </span><span id="cant-line-6979">wanted to raise one million dollars for families of the fallen, and The Today </span><span id="cant-line-6980">Show  was the biggest morning show on  television. </span><span id="cant-line-6981">I’d served in the military for nearly twenty years by that point, without a </span><span id="cant-line-6982">single infraction  on my record, and for the previous four years the Navy had </span><span id="cant-line-6983">used me as their poster boy. They put me on billboards, I was interviewed on </span><span id="cant-line-6984">CNN, and I’d jumped out of an airplane on NBC. They placed me in dozens </span><span id="cant-line-6985">of magazine and newspaper stories, which helped their recruitment mission. </span><span id="cant-line-6986">Now they were trying to stifle me for no good reason. Hell, if anybody knew </span><span id="cant-line-6987">the regulations of what I could and could not say it was me. In the nick of </span><span id="cant-line-6988">time, the Navy’ s legal department cleared me to  proceed.Billboard during my recruiting days </span><span id="cant-line-6989">My interview was brief. I told a CliffsNotes version of my life story and </span><span id="cant-line-6990">mentioned I’d be on a liquid diet, drinking a carbohydrate -loaded  sports </span><span id="cant-line-6991">drink as my only nutrition until the record was  broken. </span><span id="cant-line-6992">“What should we cook for you tomorrow once it’s all over?” Savannah </span><span id="cant-line-6993">Guthrie replied. I laughed and played along, agreeable as hell, but don’t get </span><span id="cant-line-6994">it twisted, I was way out of my comfort zone. I was about to go to war with </span><span id="cant-line-6995">myself, but I didn’ t look like it or act like it. As the clock wound down I </span><span id="cant-line-6996">took my shirt off and was wearing only a pair of lightweight, black running </span><span id="cant-line-6997">shorts and running  shoes. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-6998">“Wow, it’s like looking at myself in a mirror ,” Lauer joked, gesturing toward </span><span id="cant-line-6999">me. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7000">“This segment just got even more interesting,” said Savannah. “All right </span><span id="cant-line-7001">David, best of luck to you. W e will be  watching.”Someone hit play on Going the Distance , the Rocky  theme song, and I </span><span id="cant-line-7002">stepped to the pull-up bar. It was painted matte black , wrapped with white </span><span id="cant-line-7003">tape, and stenciled with the phrase, SHOW NO WEAKNESS in white </span><span id="cant-line-7004">lettering. I got the last word in as I strapped on my gray  gloves. </span><span id="cant-line-7005">“Please donate to specialops.or g,” I said. “We’re trying to raise a million </span><span id="cant-line-7006">dollars.” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7007">“Alright, are you ready?” Lauer asked. “Three…two…one…David, go!” </span><span id="cant-line-7008">With that, the clock started and I rocked a set of eight pull-ups. The rules </span><span id="cant-line-7009">laid down by the Guinness Book  of World Records were clear . I had to start </span><span id="cant-line-7010">each pull-up from a dead hang with arms fully extended, and my chin had to </span><span id="cant-line-7011">exceed the  bar. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7012">“So it begins,” Savannah  said. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7013">I smiled  for the camera and looked relaxed, but even those first pull-ups </span><span id="cant-line-7014">didn’ t feel right. Part of it was situational. I was a lone fish in a glass box </span><span id="cant-line-7015">aquarium that attracted sunshine and reflected a bank of hot show  lights. The </span><span id="cant-line-7016">other half was technical. From the very first pull-up I notice d that the bar </span><span id="cant-line-7017">had a lot more give than I was used to. I didn’ t have my usual power and </span><span id="cant-line-7018">anticipated a long fucking day. At first, I blocked that shit out. Had to. A </span><span id="cant-line-7019">looser bar just meant a stronger effort and gave me another oppo rtunity to be </span><span id="cant-line-7020">uncommon. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7021">Throughout the day people passed by on the street below , waved, and </span><span id="cant-line-7022">cheered. I waved back, kept to my plan, and rocked six pull-ups on the </span><span id="cant-line-7023">minute, every damn minute, but it wasn’ t easy because of that rickety bar. </span><span id="cant-line-7024">My force was getting dissipated, and after hundreds of pull-ups, dissipation </span><span id="cant-line-7025">took its toll. Each subsequent pull-up require d a monumental effort, a </span><span id="cant-line-7026">stronger grip, and at the 1,500 mark my forearms hurt like hell. My massage </span><span id="cant-line-7027">therapist rubbed  them down between sets, but they bulged with lactic acid </span><span id="cant-line-7028">which seeped into every muscle in my upper  body . </span><span id="cant-line-7029">After more than six long hours,  and with 2,000 pull-ups in the bank, I took </span><span id="cant-line-7030">my first ten-minute  break. I was well ahead of my twenty -four-hour pace, </span><span id="cant-line-7031">and the sun angled lower on the horizon, which reduced the mercury in theroom to manageable. It was late enough that the whole studio was shut </span><span id="cant-line-7032">down. It was just me, a few friends, a massage therapist, and my mother . </span><span id="cant-line-7033">Today Show  camera s were set up and rollin g to clock me and make sure I </span><span id="cant-line-7034">kept to regulations. I had more than 2,000 pull-ups still to go, and for the </span><span id="cant-line-7035">first time that day , doubt carved out a home in my  brain. </span><span id="cant-line-7036">I didn’t vocalize my negativity , and I tried to reset my mind for the second </span><span id="cant-line-7037">half push, but the truth was my whole plan had gone to hell. My </span><span id="cant-line-7038">carbohydrate drink wasn’ t giving me the power I needed, and I didn’ t have a </span><span id="cant-line-7039">Plan B, so I ordered and downed a cheesebur ger. It felt good to have some </span><span id="cant-line-7040">real food. Meanwhile, my team tried to stabilize the bar by tying it to the </span><span id="cant-line-7041">pipes in the rafters, but instead of rechar ging my system like I’d hoped, the </span><span id="cant-line-7042">long break had an adverse  effect.During first pull-up record attempt </span><span id="cant-line-7043">My body was shutting down, while my mind swirled with panic because I’d </span><span id="cant-line-7044">made a pledge and staked my name on a quest to raise money and break a </span><span id="cant-line-7045">record, and I already knew that there was no way on this earth I was gonna </span><span id="cant-line-7046">be able to get it done. It took me five hours to do another 500 pull-ups— </span><span id="cant-line-7047">that’s an averag e of under two pull-ups per minute. I was verging on total </span><span id="cant-line-7048">muscle failure after doing only 1,000 more pull-ups than I would rock in </span><span id="cant-line-7049">three hours at the gym on a typical Saturday with no ill effects. How was </span><span id="cant-line-7050">that possible?I tried to bull my way through, but tension and lactic acid had overwhelmed </span><span id="cant-line-7051">my syste m and my upper body was a lump of dough. I had never hit muscle </span><span id="cant-line-7052">failure before in my life. I’d run on broken legs in BUD/S, run nearly a </span><span id="cant-line-7053">hundred miles on broken feet, and accomplished dozens of physical feats </span><span id="cant-line-7054">with a hole in my heart. But late at night, on the second floor of the NBC </span><span id="cant-line-7055">tower , I pulled the plug. After my 2,500th pull-up, I could barely  lift my </span><span id="cant-line-7056">hands high enough to grip the bar, let alone clear it with my chin, and just </span><span id="cant-line-7057">like that, it was over. There would be no celebratory breakfast with </span><span id="cant-line-7058">Savannah and Matt. There would be no celebration at all. I failed, and I’d </span><span id="cant-line-7059">failed in front of millions of  people. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7060">So did I hang my head in shame  and misery? Fuck no! To me a failure is just </span><span id="cant-line-7061">a stepping stone to future success. The next morning, my phone was blowing </span><span id="cant-line-7062">up so I left it in my hotel room and went for a run in Central Park. I needed </span><span id="cant-line-7063">zero distractions  and time enough to go back through what I’d done well and </span><span id="cant-line-7064">where I’d fallen short. In the military , after every real-world  mission or field </span><span id="cant-line-7065">exercise, we fill out After Action Reports (AARs), which serve as live </span><span id="cant-line-7066">autopsies. We do them no matter the outcome, and if you’re analyzing a </span><span id="cant-line-7067">failure like I was, the AAR is absolutely crucial. Because when you’re </span><span id="cant-line-7068">headed into uncharted territory  there are no books to study , no YouTube </span><span id="cant-line-7069">instructional videos to watch. All I had to read were my mistakes, and I </span><span id="cant-line-7070">considered all  variables. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7071">First of all, I should never have gone on that show . My motivatio n was solid. </span><span id="cant-line-7072">It was a good idea to try to increase awareness and raise money for the </span><span id="cant-line-7073">foundation, and while I required exposure to raise the amount I’d hoped, by </span><span id="cant-line-7074">thinking of money first (always  a bad idea) I wasn’ t focused on the task at </span><span id="cant-line-7075">hand. To break this record, I needed an optimal environment, and that </span><span id="cant-line-7076">realization blasted me like a surprise attack. I didn’ t respec t the record </span><span id="cant-line-7077">enough going in. I thought I could have broken it on a rusty bar bolted to the </span><span id="cant-line-7078">back of a pick-up truck with loose shocks, so even though I tested the bar </span><span id="cant-line-7079">twice before game day, it never  bothered me enough to make a change, and </span><span id="cant-line-7080">my lack of focus and attention to detail cost me a shot at immortality . There </span><span id="cant-line-7081">were also way too many bubbly looky -loos buzzing  in and out of the room , </span><span id="cant-line-7082">asking for pictu res between sets. This was the beginning of the selfie era, </span><span id="cant-line-7083">and that sickness most definitely invaded my motherfucking safe  space.Obviously , my break was too long. I figured massage would counteract the </span><span id="cant-line-7084">swelling and lactic acid build -up, but I was wrong about that too, and I </span><span id="cant-line-7085">should have taken more salt tablets to prevent cramping. Before my attempt, </span><span id="cant-line-7086">haters found me online and predicted my failure, but I ignor ed them and </span><span id="cant-line-7087">didn’ t fully absorb the hard truths couched in their negativity . I thought, as </span><span id="cant-line-7088">long as I trained hard, the record would be mine, and as a result, I wasn’ t as </span><span id="cant-line-7089">well-prepared  as I should have  been. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7090">You can’t prepare for unknown factors, but if you have a better pre-game </span><span id="cant-line-7091">focus, you will likely only have  to deal with one or two rather than ten. In </span><span id="cant-line-7092">New York, too many bubbled up, and unknown factors usually blaze a wake </span><span id="cant-line-7093">of doubt. Afterward, I was eye to eye with my haters and acknowledged that </span><span id="cant-line-7094">my margin for error was small. I weighed 210 pounds, much heavier than </span><span id="cant-line-7095">anyone else who had ever tried to break that record, and my probability of </span><span id="cant-line-7096">failure was  high. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7097">I didn’ t touch a pull-up bar for two weeks, but once back in Honolulu I </span><span id="cant-line-7098">hammered sets at my home gym and noticed the difference in the bar right </span><span id="cant-line-7099">way. Still, I had to resist the temptation to blame everything on that loose bar </span><span id="cant-line-7100">because odds were that a firmer one wouldn’ t translate into an extra 1,521 </span><span id="cant-line-7101">pull-ups. I resea rched gymnast chalk, gloves, and taping systems. I sampled </span><span id="cant-line-7102">and experimente d. This time I wanted a fan set below the bar to cool me </span><span id="cant-line-7103">down between sets, and I switc hed up my nutrition. Instead of running off </span><span id="cant-line-7104">pure carbs I added in some protein and bananas to prevent cram ping. When </span><span id="cant-line-7105">it came time to choose a location to attempt the record, I knew  I needed to </span><span id="cant-line-7106">get back to who I am at my core. That meant losing the glitz and setting up </span><span id="cant-line-7107">shop in a dungeon. And on a trip to Nashville, I found just the place, a </span><span id="cant-line-7108">Crossfit gym a mile from my mother ’s house, owned by a former marine </span><span id="cant-line-7109">named Nandor  Tamaska. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7110">After emailing a couple of times, I ran over to Crossfit Brentwood Hills to </span><span id="cant-line-7111">meet him. It was set in a strip mall, a few doors down from a Target, and </span><span id="cant-line-7112">there was nothin g fancy about the place. It had black mat floors, buckets of </span><span id="cant-line-7113">chalk, racks of iron, and lots of hard motherfuckers doing work. When I </span><span id="cant-line-7114">walked in, the first thing I did was grab the pull-up bar and shake it. It was </span><span id="cant-line-7115">bolted into the ground just like I’d hoped. Even a little sway in the bar would </span><span id="cant-line-7116">require me to adjust my grip mid-set, and when your goal is 4,021 pull-ups,all minu scule movements accumulate into a reservoir of wasted energy, </span><span id="cant-line-7117">which takes a  toll. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7118">“This is exactly what I need,” I said, gripping the  bar. </span><span id="cant-line-7119">“Yeah,” Nandor said. “They have to be sturdy to double as our squat  racks.” </span><span id="cant-line-7120">In additi on to its strength and stability , it was the right height. I didn’t want a </span><span id="cant-line-7121">short bar, becaus e bending your legs can cause cramping in the hamstrings. I </span><span id="cant-line-7122">needed it high enough that I could grab it when standing on my  toes. </span><span id="cant-line-7123">I could tell right away that Nandor was a perfect co-conspirator  for this </span><span id="cant-line-7124">mission. He had been an enlisted man, got into Crossfit, and moved to </span><span id="cant-line-7125">Nashville from Atlanta with his wife and family to open his first gym. Not </span><span id="cant-line-7126">many people are willing to open their doors and let a stranger take over their </span><span id="cant-line-7127">gym, but Nandor was down with the W arrior Foundation  cause. </span><span id="cant-line-7128">My second attempt was schedul ed for November , and for five straight weeks </span><span id="cant-line-7129">I did 500-1,300 pull-ups a day at my home gym in Hawaii. During my last </span><span id="cant-line-7130">island session, I did 2,000 pull-ups in five hours, then caught a flight to </span><span id="cant-line-7131">Nashville, arriving six days before my  attempt. </span><span id="cant-line-7132">Nandor rallied members of his gym to act as witnesses and my support crew . </span><span id="cant-line-7133">He took care of the playlist, sourced the chalk, and set up a break room in </span><span id="cant-line-7134">back in case I needed it. He also put out a press release. I trained at his gym </span><span id="cant-line-7135">in the run-up to game day, and a local news channel came by to file a report. </span><span id="cant-line-7136">The local newspaper did a story  too. It was small scale, but Nashville was </span><span id="cant-line-7137">growing curious, especially the Crossfit junkies. Several showed up to </span><span id="cant-line-7138">absorb the scene. I spoke with Nandor recently , and I liked how he put  it. </span><span id="cant-line-7139">“People have been running for decades, and running long distances, but </span><span id="cant-line-7140">4,000 pull-ups, the human body isn’t designed  to do that. So to get a chance </span><span id="cant-line-7141">to witness something like that was pretty  neat.” </span><span id="cant-line-7142">I rested the full day before the attempt and when I showed up to the gym I </span><span id="cant-line-7143">felt strong and prepared for the minefield ahead. Nandor and my mom </span><span id="cant-line-7144">collaborated to have everything dialed in. There was a sleek digital timer on </span><span id="cant-line-7145">the wall which also tracked my count, plus they had two battery -powered </span><span id="cant-line-7146">wall clocks running as back ups. There was a Guinness Book of WorldRecords banner hanging over the bar, and a video crew because every rep </span><span id="cant-line-7147">had to be recor ded for potential review . My tape was right. My gloves </span><span id="cant-line-7148">perfect. The bar was bolted solid, and when I started out, my performance </span><span id="cant-line-7149">was explosive. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7150">The numbers remained the same. I was gunning for six pull-ups every </span><span id="cant-line-7151">minute, on the minute, and during the first ten sets I rose up chest high. Then </span><span id="cant-line-7152">I remembered my game plan to minimize needless movement and wasted </span><span id="cant-line-7153">energy. On my initial attempt I felt pressure to get my chin well over the bar, </span><span id="cant-line-7154">but while all that extra space made for a good show , it did not and would not </span><span id="cant-line-7155">help me get the damn record. This time I told myself to barely clear the bar </span><span id="cant-line-7156">with my chin, and not to use my arms and hands for anythin g other than </span><span id="cant-line-7157">pull-ups. Instead  of reaching down for my water bottle like I had in New </span><span id="cant-line-7158">York, I set it on a stack of wooden boxes (the kind used for box jumps), so </span><span id="cant-line-7159">all I had to do was turn and suck my nutrition through a straw . The first sip </span><span id="cant-line-7160">triggered me to dial back my pull-up motion and from then on, I remained </span><span id="cant-line-7161">disciplined as I piled up numbers. I was on my game and confident as hell. I </span><span id="cant-line-7162">wasn’ t thinking of just 4,020 pull-ups. I want ed to go the full twenty -four </span><span id="cant-line-7163">hours. If I did that, 5,000 was possible, or even 6,000! </span><span id="cant-line-7164">I remained hyper vigilant, scanning for any physical issues that could crop </span><span id="cant-line-7165">up and derail the attempt. All was smooth until, after almost four hours and </span><span id="cant-line-7166">1,300 pull-ups, my hands started to blister . In between sets my mom hit me </span><span id="cant-line-7167">with Second Skin so I could stay on top of the cuts. This was a new problem </span><span id="cant-line-7168">for me, and I remembered all the doubting comments I’d read on social </span><span id="cant-line-7169">media prior to my attempt. My arms were too long, they said. I weighed too </span><span id="cant-line-7170">much. My form wasn’ t ideal, I put too much pressure on my hands. I’d </span><span id="cant-line-7171">disregarded that last comment because during my first attempt I didn’ t have </span><span id="cant-line-7172">palm issues, but in the midst of my second I realized it was because the first </span><span id="cant-line-7173">bar had so much give. This time I had more stability and power , but over </span><span id="cant-line-7174">time that hard-ass bar did  damage. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7175">Still, I labored on and after 1,700 pull-ups my forearms started aching, and </span><span id="cant-line-7176">when I bent my arms, my biceps  pinched too. I remembered those sensations </span><span id="cant-line-7177">from my first go ’round. It was the beginning of cramps, so between sets I </span><span id="cant-line-7178">downed salt tablets and ate two bananas, and that took care of my muscular </span><span id="cant-line-7179">discomfort. My palms just kept getting  worse.A hundred and fifty pull-ups later I could feel them splitting down the </span><span id="cant-line-7180">middle beneath my gloves. I knew I should stop and try to fix the problem, </span><span id="cant-line-7181">but I also knew that might trigg er my body to stiffen up and shut down. I </span><span id="cant-line-7182">was fighting two fires at once and didn’ t know where to strike first. I opted </span><span id="cant-line-7183">to stay on the minute by minute pace, and in between experi mented with </span><span id="cant-line-7184">different solutions. I wore two pairs of gloves, then three. I resorted to my </span><span id="cant-line-7185">old frien d, duct tape. Didn’ t help. I couldn’ t wrap the bar in pads because </span><span id="cant-line-7186">that was against Guinness rules. All I could do was try anything and </span><span id="cant-line-7187">everything to stay in the  fight. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7188">Ten hours into the attempt, I hit a wall. I was down to three pull-ups a </span><span id="cant-line-7189">minute on the minute. The pain was excruciating and I needed some relief. I </span><span id="cant-line-7190">took my right glove off. Layers of skin came off with it. My palm looked </span><span id="cant-line-7191">like raw hambur ger. My mom called a doctor friend, Regina, who lived </span><span id="cant-line-7192">nearby and the two of us went into the back room to wait for her and try to </span><span id="cant-line-7193">salvage my record attempt. When Regina showed up she evaluated the </span><span id="cant-line-7194">situation, pulled  out a syringe, loaded it with local anesthetic  and dipped the </span><span id="cant-line-7195">needle toward the open wound on my right  hand. </span><span id="cant-line-7196">My hand during the second pull-up record attempt </span><span id="cant-line-7197">She looked over. My heart pounded, sweat saturated every inch of my skin. I </span><span id="cant-line-7198">could feel my muscles cooling down and stiffening up, but I nodded, turned </span><span id="cant-line-7199">away , and she sunk that needle in deep. It hurt so fucking bad, but I held my </span><span id="cant-line-7200">primal scream inside. Show no weakness  remained my motto, but that didn’t </span><span id="cant-line-7201">mean I felt strong. My mom pulled off my left glove, anticipating the second </span><span id="cant-line-7202">shot, but Regin a was busy examining the swelling in my biceps and the </span><span id="cant-line-7203">bulging spasms in my  forearms.“You look like you’re in rhabdo myolysis, David,” she said. “You shouldn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-7204">continue. It’s dangerous.” I had no idea what the fuck she was talking about, </span><span id="cant-line-7205">so she broke it  down. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7206">There’ s a phenomenon that happens when one muscle group is worked way </span><span id="cant-line-7207">too hard for way too long. The muscles become starved of glucose and break </span><span id="cant-line-7208">down, leaking myoglobin, a fibrous protein that stores oxygen in the muscle, </span><span id="cant-line-7209">into the bloodstr eam. When that happens, it’s up to the kidneys to filter all </span><span id="cant-line-7210">those proteins out and if they become overwhelmed, they shut down. </span><span id="cant-line-7211">“People can die from rhabdo,” she  said. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7212">My hand s throbb ed with agony . My muscles were locking up, and the stakes </span><span id="cant-line-7213">couldn’ t be higher . Any rational person would have thrown in the towel, but </span><span id="cant-line-7214">I could hear Going the Distance  booming from the speakers, and knew that </span><span id="cant-line-7215">this was my 14th round, Cut me, Mick , moment. </span><span id="cant-line-7216">Fuck rationality . I held up my left palm and had Regina sink her needle in. </span><span id="cant-line-7217">Waves of pain washed through me as a bumper crop of doubt flowered in my </span><span id="cant-line-7218">mind. She wrapped both palms in layers of gauze and medical tape and fitted </span><span id="cant-line-7219">me with a fresh pair of gloves. Then I stalked back out onto the gym floor </span><span id="cant-line-7220">and got back to work. I was at 2,900, and as long as I remained in the fight, I </span><span id="cant-line-7221">still believed anything was  possible. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7222">I did sets of twos and threes on the minute for two hours, but it felt like I was </span><span id="cant-line-7223">gripping a red hot, melting rod, which meant I was down to using my </span><span id="cant-line-7224">fingertips to grip the bar. First I used four fingers, then three. I was able to </span><span id="cant-line-7225">gut out one hund red more pull-ups, then one hundred more. Hours ticked by. </span><span id="cant-line-7226">I crept closer but with my body in rhabdo, breakdown was imminent. I did </span><span id="cant-line-7227">several sets of pull-ups with my wrist s dangling over the bar. It sounds </span><span id="cant-line-7228">impossible, but I managed until the numbing agents stopped working. Then </span><span id="cant-line-7229">even bending my fingers felt like I was stabbing myself in the hand with a </span><span id="cant-line-7230">sharp  knife. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7231">After eclipsing 3,200 pull-ups, I worked out the math and realized if I could </span><span id="cant-line-7232">do 800 sets of one, it would take thirteen hours and change to break the </span><span id="cant-line-7233">record and I would just beat the clock. I lasted forty -five minutes. The pain </span><span id="cant-line-7234">was too much and the vibe in the room went from optimistic to somber . I </span><span id="cant-line-7235">was still trying to show as little weakness as I could, but the volunteers couldsee me messin g with my gloves and grip, and knew something was </span><span id="cant-line-7236">drastically wron g. When I went into the back to regroup a second time I </span><span id="cant-line-7237">heard a collective sigh that sounded like  doom. </span><span id="cant-line-7238">Regina and my mother unwrapped the tape on my hands, and I could feel my </span><span id="cant-line-7239">flesh peeling like a banana. Both palms were filleted open down to the </span><span id="cant-line-7240">dermis, which is where our nerves lie. Achilles had his heel, and when it </span><span id="cant-line-7241">came to pull-ups, my gift, and my undoing, were my hands. The doubters </span><span id="cant-line-7242">were right. I wasn’ t one of those lightweight, graceful pull-up guys. I was </span><span id="cant-line-7243">powerful, and the power came from my grip. But now my hand better </span><span id="cant-line-7244">resembled a physiology mannequin than something  human. </span><span id="cant-line-7245">Emotionally , I was wasted. Not just because of my sheer physical exhaustion </span><span id="cant-line-7246">or becau se I couldn’ t get the record for myself, but because so many people </span><span id="cant-line-7247">had come out to help. I’d taken over Nandor ’s gym and felt like I’d </span><span id="cant-line-7248">disappointed everyone. Withou t a word, my mother and I slipped out the </span><span id="cant-line-7249">back door like we were escaping a crime scene, and as she drove to the </span><span id="cant-line-7250">hospital, I couldn’ t stop thinking, I’m better than  this! </span><span id="cant-line-7251">While Nandor and his team broke down the clocks, untied the banners, </span><span id="cant-line-7252">swept up chalk, and peeled bloody tape off their pull-up bar, my mom and I </span><span id="cant-line-7253">slumped into chairs in the ER waiting room. I was holding what was left of </span><span id="cant-line-7254">my glove. It looked like it was lifted from the OJ Simpson crime scene, like </span><span id="cant-line-7255">it had been marinated in blood. She eyeballed me and shook her  head. </span><span id="cant-line-7256">“Well,” she said, “I know one  thing…” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7257">After a long pause I turned to face  her. </span><span id="cant-line-7258">“What’ s that?” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7259">“You’re gonna do this  again.” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7260">She read my damn mind. I was already doing my live autopsy and would run </span><span id="cant-line-7261">through a complete AAR on paper as soon as my bloody hands would allow . </span><span id="cant-line-7262">I knew there was treasure in this wreckage and leverage to be gained </span><span id="cant-line-7263">somewhere. I just had to piece it together like a puzzle. And the fact that she </span><span id="cant-line-7264">realized that without my saying so fired me  up.A lot of us surround ourselves with people who speak to our desire for </span><span id="cant-line-7265">comfort. Who would rather treat the pain of our wounds and prevent further </span><span id="cant-line-7266">injury than help us callous over them and try again. We need to surround </span><span id="cant-line-7267">ourselves with people who will tell us what we need to hear, not what we </span><span id="cant-line-7268">want to hear, but at the same time not make us feel we’re up against the </span><span id="cant-line-7269">impossible. My mother was my biggest fan. Whenever I failed in life she </span><span id="cant-line-7270">was always asking me when and where I would go after it again. She never </span><span id="cant-line-7271">said, Well, maybe it isn’ t meant to  be. </span><span id="cant-line-7272">Most wars are won or lost in our own heads, and when we’re in a foxhole we </span><span id="cant-line-7273">usually aren’t alone, and we need to be confident in the quality of the heart, </span><span id="cant-line-7274">mind, and dialogue of the person hunkered down with us. Because at some </span><span id="cant-line-7275">point we will need some empowering words to keep us focused and deadly . </span><span id="cant-line-7276">In that hospital, in my own personal foxhole, I was swimming in doubt. I fell </span><span id="cant-line-7277">800 pull-ups short and I knew what 800 pull-ups felt like. That’ s a long </span><span id="cant-line-7278">fucking day! But there was nobody else I’d rather have been in that foxhole </span><span id="cant-line-7279">with. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7280">“Don’ t worry ,” she said. “I’ll start calling those witnesses up as soon as we </span><span id="cant-line-7281">get home.” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7282">“Roger that,” I said. “T ell them I’ll be back on that bar in two  months.” </span><span id="cant-line-7283">*** </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7284">In life, there is no gift as overloo ked or inevitable as failure. I’ve had quite a </span><span id="cant-line-7285">few and have learned to relish them, because if you do the forensics you’ll </span><span id="cant-line-7286">find clues about where to make adjustments and how to eventually </span><span id="cant-line-7287">accomplish your task. I’m not talking about a mental list either . After the </span><span id="cant-line-7288">second attempt, I wrote everything out long-hand , but didn’ t start with the </span><span id="cant-line-7289">obvious issue, my grip. Initially , I brainstormed everything that went well, </span><span id="cant-line-7290">because in every failure a lot of good things will have happened, and we </span><span id="cant-line-7291">must acknowledge  them. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7292">The best takeaway from the Nashville attempt was Nandor ’s place. His </span><span id="cant-line-7293">dungeon of a gym was the perfect environment for me. Yeah, I’m on social </span><span id="cant-line-7294">media, and in the spotlight from time to time, but I am not a Hollywood </span><span id="cant-line-7295">person. I get my strength from a very dark place, and Nandor ’s gym wasn’ t aphony -ass, happy factory . It was dark, sweaty, painful, and real. I called him </span><span id="cant-line-7296">the very next day and asked if I could come back to train and make another </span><span id="cant-line-7297">run at the record. I’d taken a lot of his time and energy and left behind a </span><span id="cant-line-7298">mess, so I had no idea how he’d  respond. </span><span id="cant-line-7299">“Yeah, motherfucker ,” he said. “Let’ s go!” It meant a lot to have his support </span><span id="cant-line-7300">again. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7301">Another positive  was how I handled my second meltdown. I was off the mat </span><span id="cant-line-7302">and on the comeback trail before I even saw the ER doc. That’ s where you </span><span id="cant-line-7303">want to be. You can’t let a simp le failure derail your mission, or let it worm </span><span id="cant-line-7304">so far up your ass it takes over your brain and sabotages your relationships </span><span id="cant-line-7305">with people who are close to you. Everyone fails sometimes and life isn’t </span><span id="cant-line-7306">supposed to be fair , much less bend to your every  whim. </span><span id="cant-line-7307">Luck is a capricious bitch. It won’t always go your way, so you can’t get </span><span id="cant-line-7308">trapped in this idea that just because you’ve imagined a possibility for </span><span id="cant-line-7309">yourself that you somehow deserve it. Your entitled mind is dead weight. </span><span id="cant-line-7310">Cut it loose. Don’t focus on what you think you deserve. Take aim on what </span><span id="cant-line-7311">you are willing to earn! I never blamed anyone for my failures, and I didn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-7312">hang my head in Nashville. I stayed humble and sidestepped  my entitled </span><span id="cant-line-7313">mind because I knew damn well I hadn’ t earned my record. The scoreboard </span><span id="cant-line-7314">does not lie, and I didn’ t delud e myself otherwise. Believe it or not, most </span><span id="cant-line-7315">people prefer delusion. They blame others or bad luck or chaotic </span><span id="cant-line-7316">circumstance. I didn’ t, which was  positive. </span><span id="cant-line-7317">I listed most of the equipment we used on the positive side of the AAR, as </span><span id="cant-line-7318">well. The tape and chalk worke d, and even though the bar tore me the fuck </span><span id="cant-line-7319">up, it also got me 700 additio nal pull-ups, so I was headed in the right </span><span id="cant-line-7320">direction. Anoth er positive was the support of Nandor ’s Crossfit  community . </span><span id="cant-line-7321">It felt great to be surrounded by such intense, respectful people, but this time </span><span id="cant-line-7322">I’d need  to cut the number of volunteers in half. I wanted as little buzz in </span><span id="cant-line-7323">that room as  possible. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7324">After listing out all the plusses, it was time to kick the tires on my mindset, </span><span id="cant-line-7325">and if you’re doing your post-faceplant  due diligence, you should do that </span><span id="cant-line-7326">too. That means checking yourself on how and what you were thinking </span><span id="cant-line-7327">during the preparation and execution phases of your failure. My commitmentto preparation and determinatio n in the fight are always there. They didn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-7328">waver , but my belief was shakier than I cared to admit, and as I prepared for </span><span id="cant-line-7329">my third go ’round it was imperative to move beyond  doubt. </span><span id="cant-line-7330">That wasn’t easy because after my second failure in as many attempts, the </span><span id="cant-line-7331">doubters were everywhere online. The record holder , Stephen Hyland, was </span><span id="cant-line-7332">light and spidery  strong with thick, muscular palms. He was the perfect build </span><span id="cant-line-7333">for the pull-up record, and everyone was telling me I was just too big, my </span><span id="cant-line-7334">form was too brutal, and that I should stop trying to go for it before I hurt </span><span id="cant-line-7335">myself even worse. They pointed to the scoreboard that doesn ’t lie. I was </span><span id="cant-line-7336">still over 800 pull-ups away from the record. That’ s more than I gained </span><span id="cant-line-7337">between my first and second attempts. From the beginning some of them had </span><span id="cant-line-7338">predicted my hands would give out, and when that truth revealed itself in </span><span id="cant-line-7339">Nashville it presented a big mental hurdle. Part of me wondered if those </span><span id="cant-line-7340">motherfuckers were right. If I was trying to achieve the  impossible. </span><span id="cant-line-7341">Then I thought of an English middle -distance  runner from back in the day </span><span id="cant-line-7342">named Roger Bannister . When Bannister was trying to break the four-minute </span><span id="cant-line-7343">mile in the 1950s, experts told him it couldn’ t be done, but that didn’ t stop </span><span id="cant-line-7344">him. He failed again and again , but he persevered, and when he ran his </span><span id="cant-line-7345">historic mile in 3:59.4 on May 6, 1954, he didn’ t just break a record, he </span><span id="cant-line-7346">broke open the floodgates simpl y by proving it possible. Six weeks later, his </span><span id="cant-line-7347">record was eclip sed, and by now over 1,000 runners have done what was </span><span id="cant-line-7348">once thought to be beyond human  capability . </span><span id="cant-line-7349">We are all guilty of allowing so-called  experts,  or just people who have  more </span><span id="cant-line-7350">experience in a given field than we do, to cap our potential. One of the </span><span id="cant-line-7351">reasons we love sports is because we also love watching those glass ceilings </span><span id="cant-line-7352">get shattered. If I was going to be the next athlete to smash popular </span><span id="cant-line-7353">perception, I’d need to stop listening to doubt, whether it streamed in from </span><span id="cant-line-7354">the outside or bubbled up from  within, and the best way to do that was to </span><span id="cant-line-7355">decide that the pull-up record was already mine. I didn’ t know when it </span><span id="cant-line-7356">would officially become mine. It might be in two months or twenty years, </span><span id="cant-line-7357">but once I decided it belonged to me and decoupled it from the calendar , I </span><span id="cant-line-7358">was filled with confidence and relieved of any and all pressure because my </span><span id="cant-line-7359">task morphed from trying to achieve the impossible into workin g toward an </span><span id="cant-line-7360">inevitability . But to get there, I’d have to find the tactical advan tage I’d been </span><span id="cant-line-7361">missing.A tactical review is the final and most vital piece of any live autopsy or </span><span id="cant-line-7362">AAR. And while I had improve d tactically from the first attempt—working </span><span id="cant-line-7363">on a more stable bar and minimizing wasted energy—I still fell 800 reps </span><span id="cant-line-7364">short, so we needed to delve deeper into the numbers. Six pull-ups per </span><span id="cant-line-7365">minute on the minute had failed me twice. Yes, it placed me on a fast track </span><span id="cant-line-7366">to 4,020, but I never got there. This time, I decided to start slower to go </span><span id="cant-line-7367">further . I also knew from experience that I would hit some sort of wall after </span><span id="cant-line-7368">ten hours and that my response couldn’ t be a longer break. The ten-hour </span><span id="cant-line-7369">mark smacked me in my face twice and both times I stopped for five minutes </span><span id="cant-line-7370">or longer, which led to ultimate failure pretty quickly . I needed to stay true to </span><span id="cant-line-7371">my strategy and limit any long breaks to four minutes  max. </span><span id="cant-line-7372">Now , about that pull-up bar. Yeah, it would probably tear me up again, so I </span><span id="cant-line-7373">needed to find a workaround. According to the rules, I wouldn’ t be allowed </span><span id="cant-line-7374">to switch up the distance between my hands mid-attempt . The width would </span><span id="cant-line-7375">have to remain the same from the first pull-up. The only thing I could </span><span id="cant-line-7376">change would be how I was going to protect my hands. In the run-up to my </span><span id="cant-line-7377">third attempt, I experimented with all different types of glove s. I also got </span><span id="cant-line-7378">clearance to use custom foam pads to protect my palms. I remembered </span><span id="cant-line-7379">seeing a couple SEAL buddies use slices of foam mattresses to protect their </span><span id="cant-line-7380">hands when they were lifting heavy weights, and called on a mattress </span><span id="cant-line-7381">company to custom design form -fitting  pads for my hands. Guinness </span><span id="cant-line-7382">approved the equipment, and at 10 a.m. on January 19, 2013, two months </span><span id="cant-line-7383">after failing for the second time,  I was back on the bar at Crossfit Brentwood </span><span id="cant-line-7384">Hills. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7385">I started slow and easy with five pull-ups on the minute. I didn’ t strap my </span><span id="cant-line-7386">foam pads with tape. I just held them in place around the bar, and they </span><span id="cant-line-7387">seemed to work well. Within an hour the foam had formed around my hands, </span><span id="cant-line-7388">insulating them from molten -iron hell. Or so I fucking hoped. At around the </span><span id="cant-line-7389">two-hour, 600 rep mark,  I asked Nandor to play Going the Distance  on a </span><span id="cant-line-7390">loop. I felt something click inside and went full  cybor g. </span><span id="cant-line-7391">I found a rhythm on the bar and between sets I sat on a weight bench and </span><span id="cant-line-7392">stared at the chalk -dusted  floor . My point of view narrowed into tunnel </span><span id="cant-line-7393">vision as I prepared my mind for the hell that was to come. When the first </span><span id="cant-line-7394">blister opened on my palm I knew shit was about to get real. But this time, </span><span id="cant-line-7395">thanks to my failures and forensics, I was  ready .That doesn’ t mean I was having any fun. I wasn’ t. I was over it. I didn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-7396">want to do pull-ups anymor e, but achieving goals or overcoming obstacles </span><span id="cant-line-7397">doesn’ t have to be fun. Seeds burst from the inside out in a self-destructive </span><span id="cant-line-7398">ritual of new life. Does that sound like fucking fun? Like it feels good? I </span><span id="cant-line-7399">wasn’ t in that gym to get happy or do what I wanted to be doing . I was there </span><span id="cant-line-7400">to turn myself inside out if that’s what it took to blast through any and all </span><span id="cant-line-7401">mental, emotional, and physical  barriers. </span><span id="cant-line-7402">After twelve hours, I finally hit 3,000 pull-ups, a major checkp oint for me, </span><span id="cant-line-7403">and felt like I’d run headfirst into a wall. I was exasperated, in agony , and </span><span id="cant-line-7404">my hands were starting to come apart again. I was still a long way from the </span><span id="cant-line-7405">record, and I felt all the eyeballs in the room upon me. With them came the </span><span id="cant-line-7406">crushing weight  of failure and humiliation. Suddenly , I was back in the cage </span><span id="cant-line-7407">during my third Hell Week, taping my shins and ankles before mustering up </span><span id="cant-line-7408">with a new BUD/S class who’d heard it was my last  chance. </span><span id="cant-line-7409">It takes great strength to be vulnerable enough to put your ass on the line, in </span><span id="cant-line-7410">public, and work toward a dream that feels like it’s slipping away. We all </span><span id="cant-line-7411">have eyeballs on us. Our family and friends are watching, and even if you’re </span><span id="cant-line-7412">surrounded by positive people, they will have ideas about who you are, what </span><span id="cant-line-7413">you’re good at, and how you should focus your energy. That shit is just </span><span id="cant-line-7414">human nature, and if you try to break out of their box you’ll get some </span><span id="cant-line-7415">unsolicited advice that has a way of smothering your aspirations  if you let it. </span><span id="cant-line-7416">Often our people don’t mean any harm. Nobody who cares about us actually </span><span id="cant-line-7417">wants us to get hurt. They want us to be safe, comfortable, and happy , and </span><span id="cant-line-7418">not to have to stare at the floor  in a dungeon sifting through shards of our </span><span id="cant-line-7419">broken dreams. Too bad. There’ s a lot of potential in those mom ents of pain. </span><span id="cant-line-7420">And if you figure out how to piece that picture back together , you’ll find a </span><span id="cant-line-7421">hell of a lot of power there  too! </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7422">I kept my break to just four minutes, as planned. Long enough to stuff my </span><span id="cant-line-7423">hands, and those foam pads, into a pair of padded gloves. But when I got </span><span id="cant-line-7424">back on the bar I felt slow and weak. Nandor , his wife, and the other </span><span id="cant-line-7425">volunteers saw my struggle, but they left me the fuck alone to put in my ear </span><span id="cant-line-7426">buds, channel Rocky Balboa, and keep grinding one rep at a time. I went </span><span id="cant-line-7427">from four pull-ups on the minute to three, and found my cybor g trance again. </span><span id="cant-line-7428">I went ugly, I got dark. I imagined my pain was the creation of a mad </span><span id="cant-line-7429">scientist named Stephen Hyland, the evil genius who was in temporarypossession of my record and my soul. It was him! That moth erfucker was </span><span id="cant-line-7430">torturing me from across the globe, and it was up to me and only me to keep </span><span id="cant-line-7431">piling up numbers and steamroll toward him, if I wanted to take his </span><span id="cant-line-7432">motherfucking  soul! </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7433">To be clear , I wasn’t angry with Hyland—I don’t even know him! I went </span><span id="cant-line-7434">there to find the edge I needed to keep going. I got personal with him in my </span><span id="cant-line-7435">head, not out of overconfidence or envy , but to drown out my own doubt. </span><span id="cant-line-7436">Life is a head game. This was just the latest angle I used to win a game </span><span id="cant-line-7437">within that game. I had to find an edge somewhere, and if you find it in the </span><span id="cant-line-7438">person standing in your way , that’ s potent. </span><span id="cant-line-7439">As the hours ticked past midnight I started closing the distance between us, </span><span id="cant-line-7440">but the pull-ups weren’t coming fast and they weren’ t coming easy. I was </span><span id="cant-line-7441">tired mentally and physically , deep into rhabdo, and I was down to three </span><span id="cant-line-7442">pull-ups a minu te. When I hit 3,800 pull-ups I felt like I could see the </span><span id="cant-line-7443">mountain top. I also knew it was possible to go from being able to do three </span><span id="cant-line-7444">pull-ups to no pull-ups in a flash. There are stories of people at Badwater </span><span id="cant-line-7445">who reached mile 129 and couldn’ t finish a 135-mile race! You never know </span><span id="cant-line-7446">when you’ll reach your 100 percent and hit the point of total muscle fatigue. </span><span id="cant-line-7447">I kept waiting for that moment to come, when I couldn’ t pick my arms up </span><span id="cant-line-7448">anymore. Doubt stalked me like a shadow . I tried my best to control it or </span><span id="cant-line-7449">silence it, yet it kept reappearing, following me, pushing  me. </span><span id="cant-line-7450">After seventeen hours of pain, around 3 a.m. on January 20, 2013, I did my </span><span id="cant-line-7451">4,020th and 4,021st pull-up, and the record  was mine. Everyone in the gym </span><span id="cant-line-7452">cheered, but I stayed composed. After two more sets and 4,030 total pull- </span><span id="cant-line-7453">ups, I took my headphones out, stared into the camera and said, “I tracked </span><span id="cant-line-7454">you down, Stephen  Hyland!” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7455">In one day, I’d lifted the equiv alent of 846,030 pounds, nearly three times </span><span id="cant-line-7456">the weight of the Space Shuttle!  Cheers spread to laughter as I pulled off my </span><span id="cant-line-7457">gloves and disappeared into the back room, but much to everyone’ s surprise, </span><span id="cant-line-7458">I was not in the mood to  celebrate. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7459">Does that shock you too? You know that my refrigerator is never full, and it </span><span id="cant-line-7460">never will be because I live a mission -driven  life, always on the hunt for the </span><span id="cant-line-7461">next challenge. That mindset is the reason I broke that record, finishedBadwater , became a SEAL, rocked Ranger School, and on down the list. In </span><span id="cant-line-7462">my mind I’m that racehorse always chasing a carrot I’ll never catch, forever </span><span id="cant-line-7463">trying to prove myself to mysel f. And when you live that way and attain a </span><span id="cant-line-7464">goal, success feels anti-climactic . </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7465">Unlike my initial shot at the record, my success barely made a ripple in the </span><span id="cant-line-7466">news cycle. Which was just fine. I wasn’ t doing it for adulation. I raised </span><span id="cant-line-7467">some money , and I learned all I could from that pull-up bar. After logging </span><span id="cant-line-7468">more than 67,00 0 pull-ups in nine months, it was time to put them in my </span><span id="cant-line-7469">Cookie Jar and move on. Becau se life is one long motherfucking imaginary </span><span id="cant-line-7470">game that has no scoreboard, no referee, and isn’t over until we’re dead and </span><span id="cant-line-7471">buried. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7472">And all I’d ever wanted from it was to become successful in my own eyes. </span><span id="cant-line-7473">That didn’t mean wealth or celebrity, a garage full of hot cars, or a harem of </span><span id="cant-line-7474">beautiful wome n trailing after me. It meant becoming the hardest </span><span id="cant-line-7475">motherfucker who ever lived. Sure, I stacked up some failures along the </span><span id="cant-line-7476">way, but in my mind the record proved that I was close. Only the game </span><span id="cant-line-7477">wasn’ t over, and being hard came with the requirement to drain every drop </span><span id="cant-line-7478">of ability from my mind, body , and soul before the whistle  blew . </span><span id="cant-line-7479">I would remain in constant pursuit. I wouldn’ t leave anything on the table. I </span><span id="cant-line-7480">wanted to earn my final resting place. That’ s how I thought back then, </span><span id="cant-line-7481">anyway .

WHA T IF? </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7510">BEFORE  THE  RACE  EVEN  KICKED  OFF  I KNEW  I WAS  FUCKED . I N  2014, THE </span><span id="cant-line-7511">National Park Service wouldn’ t approve the traditional Badwater course, so </span><span id="cant-line-7512">Chris Kostman redrew the map. Instead of starting in Death Valley National </span><span id="cant-line-7513">Park and runnin g forty-two miles through the hottest desert on the planet, it </span><span id="cant-line-7514">would launch further upcountry at the base of a twenty-two-mile climb. That </span><span id="cant-line-7515">wasn’ t my problem. It was the fact that I toed the line eleven pounds over </span><span id="cant-line-7516">my usual race weight, and had gained ten of those pounds in the previous </span><span id="cant-line-7517">seven days. I wasn’ t a fat ass. To the average eye I looked fit, but Badwater </span><span id="cant-line-7518">wasn’ t an average race. To run and finish strong, my condition needed to be </span><span id="cant-line-7519">tip top, and I was far from it. Whatever was happening to me came as a </span><span id="cant-line-7520">shock, because after two years of substandard running, I thought I’d gotten </span><span id="cant-line-7521">my powers  back. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7522">The previous January I’d won a one-hundred -kilometer  glacial trail race </span><span id="cant-line-7523">called Frozen Otter . It wasn’ t as hard as the Hurt 100 but it was close. Set in </span><span id="cant-line-7524">Wisconsin, just outside Milwauk ee, the course laid out like a lopsided figure </span><span id="cant-line-7525">eight, with the start-finish  at the center . We passed it between the two loops, </span><span id="cant-line-7526">which enabled us to stock up on food and other necessary supplies from our </span><span id="cant-line-7527">cars, and stuff them into our packs with our emer gency supplies. The </span><span id="cant-line-7528">weather can turn evil out there, and race organizers compil ed a list of </span><span id="cant-line-7529">necessities we were required to have on us at all times so we wouldn’ t die of </span><span id="cant-line-7530">dehydration, hypothermia, or  exposure. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7531">The first lap was the larger loop of the two and when we set off the </span><span id="cant-line-7532">temperature was sitting at zero degrees Fahrenheit. Those trails were never </span><span id="cant-line-7533">plowed. In some places, snow piled into drifts. In others the trails seemed </span><span id="cant-line-7534">purposefully glazed with slick ice. Which presented a problem because Iwasn’ t wearing boots or trail shoes like most of my competitors. I laced up </span><span id="cant-line-7535">my standard running shoes, and tucked them into some cheap ass crampons, </span><span id="cant-line-7536">which theoretically were supposed to grip the ice and keep me upright. Well, </span><span id="cant-line-7537">the ice won that war and my crampons snapped off in the first hour. </span><span id="cant-line-7538">Nevertheless, I was leading the race and breaking trail in an average of six to </span><span id="cant-line-7539">twelve inches of snow . In some places the drifts were piled much higher . My </span><span id="cant-line-7540">feet were cold and wet from the starting gun, and within two hours they felt </span><span id="cant-line-7541">frozen through, especially my toes. My top half wasn’ t faring much better . </span><span id="cant-line-7542">When you sweat in below -freezing  temperature, salt on your body chafes the </span><span id="cant-line-7543">skin. My underarms and chest were cracking raspberry red. I was covered in </span><span id="cant-line-7544">rashes, my toes hurt with every step, but none of that registered too high on </span><span id="cant-line-7545">my pain scale, because I was running  free. </span><span id="cant-line-7546">For the first time since my second heart surgery, my body was beginning to </span><span id="cant-line-7547">put itself back together . I was getting 100 percent of my oxygen supply like </span><span id="cant-line-7548">everyone else, my endurance and strength were next-level , and though the </span><span id="cant-line-7549">trail was a slippery mess, my technique was dialed -in too. I was way out </span><span id="cant-line-7550">front and stoppe d at my car for a sandwich before the last twenty -two-mile </span><span id="cant-line-7551">loop. My toes throbbed with evil pain. I suspected they were frostbitten, </span><span id="cant-line-7552">which meant I was in danger of losing some of them, but I didn’t want to </span><span id="cant-line-7553">take off my shoes and look. Once again, doubt and fear were popping in my </span><span id="cant-line-7554">brain, reminding me that only a handful of people had ever finished the </span><span id="cant-line-7555">Frozen Otter , and that no lead was safe in that kind of cold. Weather , more </span><span id="cant-line-7556">than any other variable, can break a motherfucker down quick. But I didn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-7557">listen to any of that. I created a new dialogue and told myself to finish the </span><span id="cant-line-7558">race strong and worry about amputated toes at the hospital  after I was </span><span id="cant-line-7559">crowned  champion. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7560">I ran back onto the course. A blast of sun had melted some of the snow </span><span id="cant-line-7561">earlier in the day, but the cold wind iced up the trail nicely . As I ran, I </span><span id="cant-line-7562">flashed to my first year at Hurt 100 and the great Karl Meltzer . Back then, I </span><span id="cant-line-7563">was a plodder . I hit the turf with my heel first, and peeling the muddy trail </span><span id="cant-line-7564">with the entire surface area of my foot increased my odds of slipping and </span><span id="cant-line-7565">falling. Karl didn’t run like that. He moved like a goat, bouncin g on his toes </span><span id="cant-line-7566">and running along the edges of the trail. As soon as his toes hit the ground he </span><span id="cant-line-7567">fired his legs into the air. That’s why he looked like he was floating. By </span><span id="cant-line-7568">design, he barely touched the ground, while his head and core remained </span><span id="cant-line-7569">stable and engaged. From that moment onward, his movements werepermanently etched in my brain like a cave painting. I visualized them all the </span><span id="cant-line-7570">time and put his techniques into practice during training  runs. </span><span id="cant-line-7571">They say it takes sixty -six days to build a habit. For me it takes a hell of a lot </span><span id="cant-line-7572">longer than that, but I eventually get there, and during all those years of ultra </span><span id="cant-line-7573">training and competition I was working on my craft. A true runner analyzes </span><span id="cant-line-7574">their form. We didn’ t learn how to do that in the SEALs, but being around so </span><span id="cant-line-7575">many ultra runners for years, I was able to absorb and practice skills that </span><span id="cant-line-7576">seemed unnatural at first. At Frozen Otter , my main focus was to hit the </span><span id="cant-line-7577">ground soft; to touch it just enough to explode. During my third BUD/S </span><span id="cant-line-7578">class and then my first platoon, when I was considered one of the better </span><span id="cant-line-7579">runners, my head bounced all over the place. My weight wasn’ t balanced </span><span id="cant-line-7580">and when my foot hit the groun d all my weight would be supported by that </span><span id="cant-line-7581">one leg, which led to some awkward falls on slippery terrain. Through trial </span><span id="cant-line-7582">and error , and thousands of hours of training, I learned to maintain  balance. </span><span id="cant-line-7583">At Frozen Otter it all came together . With speed and grace, I navigated steep, </span><span id="cant-line-7584">slippery trails. I kept my head flat and still, my motion quiet as possible, and </span><span id="cant-line-7585">my steps  silent by running on the front of my feet. When I picked up speed, </span><span id="cant-line-7586">it was as if I’d disappeared into a white wind, elevated into a meditative </span><span id="cant-line-7587">state. I became Karl Meltzer . Now it was me who looked to be levitating </span><span id="cant-line-7588">over an impossible trail, and I finished the race in sixteen hours, smashing </span><span id="cant-line-7589">the course record and winning the Frozen Otter title without losing any  toes.Toes after Frozen Otter </span><span id="cant-line-7590">Two years earlier I was stricken with dizzy spells during easy six-mile runs. </span><span id="cant-line-7591">In 2013, I was forced to walk over one-hundred  miles of Badwater , and </span><span id="cant-line-7592">finished in seventeenth place. I’d been on a downslide and thought my days </span><span id="cant-line-7593">of contention for titles were long past over. After Frozen Otter , I was </span><span id="cant-line-7594">tempted to believe I’d made it all the way back and then some,  and that my </span><span id="cant-line-7595">best ultra years were actually ahead of me. I took that energy into my </span><span id="cant-line-7596">preparations for Badwater  2014. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7597">I was living in Chicago at the time, working as an instructor in BUD/S prep, </span><span id="cant-line-7598">a school that prepared candidates to deal with the harsh reality they would </span><span id="cant-line-7599">face in BUD/S. After more than twenty years, I was in my final year of </span><span id="cant-line-7600">military service,  and by being placed in a position to drop wisdom on the </span><span id="cant-line-7601">would -bes and wanna -bes, it felt like I’d come full circle . As usual I would </span><span id="cant-line-7602">run ten miles to work and back, and squeeze in another eight miles during </span><span id="cant-line-7603">lunch when I could. On the weekends I’d do at least one thirty -five- to forty -mile run. It all added up to a success ion of 130-mile weeks and I was feeling </span><span id="cant-line-7604">strong. As sprin g bloomed I added a heat training component by slipping on </span><span id="cant-line-7605">four or five layers of sweats, a beanie, and a Gore -Tex jacket before hitting </span><span id="cant-line-7606">the streets. When I’d show up at work, my fellow SEAL instru ctors would </span><span id="cant-line-7607">watch, amazed, as I peeled off my wet clothes and stuffed them into black </span><span id="cant-line-7608">trash bags that together weighed nearly fifteen  pounds. </span><span id="cant-line-7609">I started  my taper four weeks out, and went from 130-mile weeks to an </span><span id="cant-line-7610">eighty -mile week, then down to sixty , forty , and twenty . Tapering is </span><span id="cant-line-7611">supposed to generate an abunda nce of energy as you eat and rest, enabling </span><span id="cant-line-7612">the body  to repair all the damag e done and get you primed for competition. </span><span id="cant-line-7613">Instead, I’d never felt worse. I wasn’ t hungry and couldn’ t sleep at all. Some </span><span id="cant-line-7614">people said my body was starved of calories. Others suggeste d I might be </span><span id="cant-line-7615">low on sodium. My doctor measured my thyroid and it was a little off, but </span><span id="cant-line-7616">the readings weren’ t so bad to explain how shitty I felt. Perhaps the </span><span id="cant-line-7617">explanation was simple. That I was over-trained . </span><span id="cant-line-7618">Two weeks before the race I considered pulling out. I worrie d it was my </span><span id="cant-line-7619">heart again because on easy runs I felt a surge of adrenaline that I couldn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-7620">vent. Even a mellow pace sent my pulse racing into arrhythmia. Ten days </span><span id="cant-line-7621">before the race, I landed in Vegas. I’d scheduled five runs but couldn’ t get </span><span id="cant-line-7622">past the three -mile mark on any of them. I wasn’ t eating that much but the </span><span id="cant-line-7623">weight kept piling on. It was all water . I sought out another doctor who </span><span id="cant-line-7624">confirmed there  was nothing physically wrong with me and when I heard </span><span id="cant-line-7625">that, I was not about to be a  pussy . </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7626">During the open ing miles and initial climb of Badwater 2014, my heart rate </span><span id="cant-line-7627">ran high, but part of that was the altitude, and twenty -two miles later I made </span><span id="cant-line-7628">it to the top in sixth or seventh place. Surprised and proud, I thought, let’s </span><span id="cant-line-7629">see if I can go downhill. I’ve never enjoyed the brutality of running down a </span><span id="cant-line-7630">steep incline because it shreds the quads, but I also thought it would allow </span><span id="cant-line-7631">me to reset and calm my breath. My body refused. I couldn’ t catch my </span><span id="cant-line-7632">breath at all. I hit the flat sectio n at the bottom, slowed my pace, and began </span><span id="cant-line-7633">to walk. My competitors passed me by as my thighs twitched uncontrollably . </span><span id="cant-line-7634">My muscle spasms were so bad, my quads looked like there was an alien </span><span id="cant-line-7635">rattling around inside  them.And I still didn’ t stop! I walked for four full miles before seeking shelter in a </span><span id="cant-line-7636">Lone Pine motel room where the Badwater medical team had set up shop. </span><span id="cant-line-7637">They checked me out and saw that my blood pressure was a bit low but </span><span id="cant-line-7638">easily corrected. They couldn’ t find a single metric that could explain how </span><span id="cant-line-7639">fucked I  felt. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7640">I ate some solid food, rested and decided to try one more time.  There was a </span><span id="cant-line-7641">flat section leavi ng Lone Pine and I thought if I could knock that out perhaps </span><span id="cant-line-7642">I’d catch a second wind, but six or seven miles later my sails were still </span><span id="cant-line-7643">empty , and I’d given all I had. My muscles trembled and twitched, my heart </span><span id="cant-line-7644">jumped up and down the chart. I looked over at my pacer and said, “That’ s </span><span id="cant-line-7645">it, man. I’m  done.” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7646">My support vehicle pulled up behind us and I climbed inside. A few minutes </span><span id="cant-line-7647">later I was layin g on that same motel bed, with my tail between  my legs. I’d </span><span id="cant-line-7648">lasted just fifty miles, but any humiliation that came with quitting—not </span><span id="cant-line-7649">something I was used to—was drowned out by an instinct that something </span><span id="cant-line-7650">was way the fuck off. It wasn’ t my fear talking or my desire for comfort. </span><span id="cant-line-7651">This time, I was certain that if I didn’ t stop trying to break through this </span><span id="cant-line-7652">barrier , I wouldn’ t make it out of the Sierras  alive. </span><span id="cant-line-7653">We left Lone Pine for Las Vegas the next night, and for two days I did my </span><span id="cant-line-7654">best to rest and recover , hoping my body would settle somewhere close to </span><span id="cant-line-7655">equilibrium. We were staying at the Wynn, and on that third morning I went </span><span id="cant-line-7656">for a jog to see if I had anything in the tank. One mile later, my heart was in </span><span id="cant-line-7657">my throat, and I shut it down.  I walked back to the hotel, knowing that </span><span id="cant-line-7658">despite what the doctors said, I was sick and suspected that whatever I had </span><span id="cant-line-7659">was serious. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7660">Later that night, after seeing a movie in the Vegas suburbs, I felt weak as we </span><span id="cant-line-7661">strolled to a nearby restaurant, the Elephant Bar. My mom was a few paces </span><span id="cant-line-7662">ahead and I saw her in triplicate. I clenched my eyes shut, released them, and </span><span id="cant-line-7663">there were still three of her. She held the door open for me and when I </span><span id="cant-line-7664">stepped into the cool confines, I felt a bit better . We slid into a booth </span><span id="cant-line-7665">opposite one another . I was too unsteady to read the menu and asked her to </span><span id="cant-line-7666">order for me. From there, it got worse, and when the runner showed up with </span><span id="cant-line-7667">our food, my vision blurred again. I strained to open my eyes wide and felt </span><span id="cant-line-7668">woozy as my mother looked to be floating above the  table.“You’re going to have to call an ambulance,” I said, “because I’m going </span><span id="cant-line-7669">down.” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7670">Desperate for some stability , I laid my head on the table, but my mom didn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-7671">dial 911. She crossed to my side and I leaned on her as we made our way to </span><span id="cant-line-7672">the hostess stand and then back to the car. On the way I shared as much of </span><span id="cant-line-7673">my medical history as I could recall, in short bursts, in case I lost </span><span id="cant-line-7674">consciousness and she did have to call for help. Luckily , my vision and </span><span id="cant-line-7675">energy improved enough for her to drive me to the emer gency room  herself. </span><span id="cant-line-7676">My thyroid had been flagged in the past, so that’s the first thing  the doctors </span><span id="cant-line-7677">explored. Many Navy SEALs have thyroid issues when they reach their </span><span id="cant-line-7678">thirties, because  when you put motherfuckers in extreme environments like </span><span id="cant-line-7679">Hell Week and war, their horm one levels go haywire. When the thyroid </span><span id="cant-line-7680">gland is suboptimal, fatigue, muscle aches, and weakness are among more </span><span id="cant-line-7681">than a dozen major side effects, but my thyroid levels were close to normal. </span><span id="cant-line-7682">My heart checked out too. The ER docs in Vegas told me all I needed was </span><span id="cant-line-7683">rest. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7684">I went back to Chicago and saw my own doctor who ordered a battery of </span><span id="cant-line-7685">blood tests. His office tested my endocrine system and screened me for </span><span id="cant-line-7686">Lyme, hepatitis, Rheumatoid arthritis, and a handful of other autoimmune </span><span id="cant-line-7687">diseases. Everything came back clean except for my thyroid which was </span><span id="cant-line-7688">slightly suboptim al, but that didn’t explain how I’d morphed so fast from an </span><span id="cant-line-7689">elite athlete capable of running hundreds of miles into a pretend er who could </span><span id="cant-line-7690">barely muster the ener gy to tie his shoes, let alone run a mile without ver ging </span><span id="cant-line-7691">on collapse. I was in medical no-man’s-land. I left his office with more </span><span id="cant-line-7692">questions than answers and a prescription for thyroid  medication. </span><span id="cant-line-7693">Each day that went by I felt worse. Everything was crashing on me. I had </span><span id="cant-line-7694">trouble getting out of bed, I was constipated and achy. They took more blood </span><span id="cant-line-7695">and decided I had Addison’ s disease, an autoimmune illness that occurs </span><span id="cant-line-7696">when your adrenals are draine d and your body doesn’ t produce enough </span><span id="cant-line-7697">cortisol, which was common in SEALs because we’re primed to run on </span><span id="cant-line-7698">adrenaline. My doctor prescribed the steroid Hydrocortisone, DHEA, and </span><span id="cant-line-7699">Arimidex among other meds, but taking his pills only accelerated my </span><span id="cant-line-7700">decline, and after that, he and the other doctors I saw were tapped out. The </span><span id="cant-line-7701">look in their eyes said it all. In their minds, I was either a crazyhypochondriac, or I was dying and they didn’ t know what was killing me or </span><span id="cant-line-7702">how to heal  me. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7703">I fought through it the best I could. My coworkers didn’ t know anything </span><span id="cant-line-7704">about my decline because I continued to show no weakness. My whole life </span><span id="cant-line-7705">I’d been hiding all my insecurities and trauma. I kept all my vulnerabilities </span><span id="cant-line-7706">locked down beneath an iron veneer, but eventually the pain became so bad I </span><span id="cant-line-7707">couldn’ t even get out of bed. I called in sick and lay there, staring at the </span><span id="cant-line-7708">ceiling, and wondered, could this be the  end? </span><span id="cant-line-7709">Peering into the abyss sent my mind reeling back through the days, weeks, </span><span id="cant-line-7710">years, like fingers flipping through old files. I found all the best parts and </span><span id="cant-line-7711">tacked them together into a highlight loop streamed on repeat. I grew up beat </span><span id="cant-line-7712">down and abused, filtered uneducated through a system that rejected me at </span><span id="cant-line-7713">every turn, until I took ownersh ip and started to change. Since then I’d been </span><span id="cant-line-7714">obese. I was married and divorced. I had two heart surgeries, taught myself </span><span id="cant-line-7715">to swim, and learned to run on broken legs. I was terrified of heights, then </span><span id="cant-line-7716">took up high altitude sky diving. Water scared the living shit out of me, yet I </span><span id="cant-line-7717">became a technical diver and underwater navigator , which is several degrees </span><span id="cant-line-7718">of difficulty beyond scuba diving. I competed in more than sixty ultra </span><span id="cant-line-7719">distance races, winning several, and set a pull-up record. I stuttered through </span><span id="cant-line-7720">my early years in primary school and grew up to become the Navy SEALs’ </span><span id="cant-line-7721">most trusted public speaker . I’d served my country on the battlefield. Along </span><span id="cant-line-7722">the way I became driven to make sure that I could not be defined by the </span><span id="cant-line-7723">abuse I was born into or the bullying that I grew up with. I wouldn’ t be </span><span id="cant-line-7724">defined by talent either , I didn’ t have much, or my own fears and </span><span id="cant-line-7725">weaknesses. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7726">I was the sum total of the obstacles I’d overcome. And even though I’d told </span><span id="cant-line-7727">my story to students all over the country , I never stopped long enough to </span><span id="cant-line-7728">appreciate the tale I told or the life I’d built. In my mind, I didn’ t have the </span><span id="cant-line-7729">time to waste. I never hit snooze  on my life clock because there was always </span><span id="cant-line-7730">something else to do. If I worked a twenty -hour day, I’d work out for an </span><span id="cant-line-7731">hour and sleep for three, but I made sure to get that motherfu cker in. My </span><span id="cant-line-7732">brain wasn’t wired to appreciate, it was programmed to do work, scan the </span><span id="cant-line-7733">horizon, ask what’ s next, and get it done. That’ s why I piled up so many rare </span><span id="cant-line-7734">feats. I was always on the hunt for the next big thing, but as I lay there in </span><span id="cant-line-7735">bed, my body taut with tension  and throbbing with pain, I had a clear ideawhat was next for me. The cemetery . After years of abuse, I’d finally </span><span id="cant-line-7736">shredded my physical body beyond  repair . </span><span id="cant-line-7737">I was  dying. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7738">For weeks and months, I search ed for a cure to my medical mystery , but in </span><span id="cant-line-7739">that moment of catharsis I didn’ t feel sad and I didn’ t feel cheated. I was </span><span id="cant-line-7740">only thirty -eight  years old, but I’d lived ten lives and experienced a hell of a </span><span id="cant-line-7741">lot more than most eighty -year-olds. I wasn ’t feeling sorry for myself. It </span><span id="cant-line-7742">made sense that at some point the toll would come due. I spent hours </span><span id="cant-line-7743">reflecting back on my journey . This time, I wasn’ t sifting through the Cookie </span><span id="cant-line-7744">Jar while in the heat of battle hoping to find a ticket to victo ry. I wasn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-7745">leveraging my life assets toward some new end. No, I was done fighting, and </span><span id="cant-line-7746">all I felt was  gratitude. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7747">I wasn’ t meant to be this person! I had to fight myself at every turn, and my </span><span id="cant-line-7748">destroyed body was my biggest trophy . In that moment I knew it didn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-7749">matter if I ever ran again, if I couldn’ t operate anymore, or if I lived or died, </span><span id="cant-line-7750">and with that acceptance came deep  appreciation. </span><span id="cant-line-7751">My eyes welled with tears. Not because I was afraid, but because at my </span><span id="cant-line-7752">lowest point I found clarity . The kid I always judged so harshly didn’ t lie and </span><span id="cant-line-7753">cheat to hurt anyone’s feelings. He did it for acceptance. He broke the rules </span><span id="cant-line-7754">because he didn’ t have the tools to compete and was ashamed for being </span><span id="cant-line-7755">dumb. He did it because he need ed friends. I was afraid to tell the teachers I </span><span id="cant-line-7756">couldn’ t read. I was terrified of the stigma associated with special education, </span><span id="cant-line-7757">and instead of coming down on that kid for one more second, instead of </span><span id="cant-line-7758">chastising my younger self, I understood him for the first  time. </span><span id="cant-line-7759">It was a lonely journey from there to here. I missed out on so much. I didn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-7760">have a lot of fun. Happiness wasn’ t my cocktail of choice. My brain had me </span><span id="cant-line-7761">on constant blast. I lived in fear and doubt, terrified of being a nobody and </span><span id="cant-line-7762">contributing nothing. I’d judged  myself constantly and I’d judged everyone </span><span id="cant-line-7763">else around me, too. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7764">Rage is a power ful thing. For years I’d raged at the world, channeled all my </span><span id="cant-line-7765">pain from my past and used it as fuel to propel me into the motherfucking </span><span id="cant-line-7766">stratosphere, but I couldn’ t always control the blast radius. Sometimes myrage scorched people who weren’ t as strong as I’d become, or didn’ t work as </span><span id="cant-line-7767">hard, and I didn’ t swallow my tongue or hide my judgment. I let them know , </span><span id="cant-line-7768">and that hurt some of the people around me, and it allowed people who </span><span id="cant-line-7769">didn’ t like me to affect my milit ary career . But lying in bed on that Chicago </span><span id="cant-line-7770">morning in the fall of 2014, I let all that judgment  go. </span><span id="cant-line-7771">I released myself and everyone I ever knew from any and all guilt and </span><span id="cant-line-7772">bitterness. The long list of haters, doubters, racists, and abusers that </span><span id="cant-line-7773">populated my past, I just couldn’ t hate them anymore. I appreciated them </span><span id="cant-line-7774">because they helped create me. And as that feeling stretched out, my mind </span><span id="cant-line-7775">quieted down. I’d been fighting a war for thirty -eight  years, and now , at what </span><span id="cant-line-7776">looked and felt like the very end, I found  peace. </span><span id="cant-line-7777">In this life there are countless trails to self-realization , though most demand </span><span id="cant-line-7778">intense discipline, so very few take them. In southern Africa, the San people </span><span id="cant-line-7779">dance for thirty hours straight as a way to commune with the divine. In </span><span id="cant-line-7780">Tibet, pilgrims rise, kneel, then stretch out face down on the ground before </span><span id="cant-line-7781">rising again, in a ritual of prostration for weeks and months, as they cover </span><span id="cant-line-7782">thousands of miles before arrivi ng at a sacred temple and folding into deep </span><span id="cant-line-7783">meditation. In Japan there’ s a sect of Zen monks that run 1,000 marathons in </span><span id="cant-line-7784">1,000 days in a quest to find enlightenment through pain and suffering. I </span><span id="cant-line-7785">don’t know if you could call what I felt on that bed “enlightenment,” but I do </span><span id="cant-line-7786">know that pain unlocks a secret doorway in the mind. One that leads to both </span><span id="cant-line-7787">peak performance and beautiful  silence. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7788">At first, when you push beyond your perceived capability your mind won’ t </span><span id="cant-line-7789">shut the fuck up about it. It wants you to stop so it sends you into a spin </span><span id="cant-line-7790">cycle of panic and doubt, which only amplifies your self-torture . But when </span><span id="cant-line-7791">you persist past that to the point that pain fully saturates the mind, you </span><span id="cant-line-7792">become single -pointed . The external world zeroes out. Boundaries dissolve </span><span id="cant-line-7793">and you feel connected to yourself, and to all things, in the depth of your </span><span id="cant-line-7794">soul. That’ s what I was after. Those moments of total connection and power , </span><span id="cant-line-7795">which came through me again in an even deeper way as I reflected on where </span><span id="cant-line-7796">I’d come from and all I’d put myself  through. </span><span id="cant-line-7797">For hours, I floated in that tranquil space, surrounded by light, feeling as </span><span id="cant-line-7798">much gratitude as pain, as much appreciation as there was discomfort. At </span><span id="cant-line-7799">some point the reverie broke like a fever . I smiled, placed my palms over mywatery eyes and rubbed the top and then the back of my head. At the base of </span><span id="cant-line-7800">my neck, I felt a familiar knot. It bulged bigger than ever. I threw off the </span><span id="cant-line-7801">covers and exam ined the knots above my hip flexors next. Thos e had grown </span><span id="cant-line-7802">too. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7803">Could it be that basic? Could  my suffering be linked to those knots? I </span><span id="cant-line-7804">flashed back to a session with an expert in stretching and advan ced physical </span><span id="cant-line-7805">and mental training methods the SEALs brought to our base in Coronado in </span><span id="cant-line-7806">2010 named Joe Hippensteel. Joe was an undersized decathlete in college, </span><span id="cant-line-7807">driven to make the Olympic team. But when you’re a 5’8” guy going up </span><span id="cant-line-7808">against world -class  decathletes who average 6’3” that isn’t easy. He decided </span><span id="cant-line-7809">to build up his lower body so he could override his genetics to jump higher </span><span id="cant-line-7810">and run faster than his bigger , stronger opponents. At one point he was </span><span id="cant-line-7811">squatting twice his own body weight for ten sets of ten reps in one session, </span><span id="cant-line-7812">but with that increase in muscle mass came a lot of tension, and tension </span><span id="cant-line-7813">invited injury . The harder he trained, the more injuries he developed and the </span><span id="cant-line-7814">more physical therapists he visited. When he was told he tore his hamstring </span><span id="cant-line-7815">before the trials, his Olympic dream died, and he realized he needed to </span><span id="cant-line-7816">change the way he trained his body . He began balancing his strength work </span><span id="cant-line-7817">with extensive stretching and noticed whenever he reached a certain range of </span><span id="cant-line-7818">motion in a given muscle group or joint, whatever pain lingered, vanished. </span><span id="cant-line-7819">He became his own guinea pig and developed optimal ranges of motion for </span><span id="cant-line-7820">every muscle and joint in the human body . He never went to the doctor or </span><span id="cant-line-7821">physical therapists again because he found his own methodologies much </span><span id="cant-line-7822">more effective. If an injury cropped up, he treated himself with a stretching </span><span id="cant-line-7823">regimen. Over the years he built up a clientele and reputation among elite </span><span id="cant-line-7824">athletes in the area, and in 2010, was introduced to some Navy SEALs. </span><span id="cant-line-7825">Word spread at Naval Special Warfare Command and he was eventually </span><span id="cant-line-7826">invited to introduce his range of motion routine to about two dozen SEALs. I </span><span id="cant-line-7827">was one of  them. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7828">As he lectured, he examined and stretched us out. The problem with most of </span><span id="cant-line-7829">the guys, he said, was our overuse of muscles without the appropriate </span><span id="cant-line-7830">balance of flexibility , and those  issues traced back to Hell Week, when we </span><span id="cant-line-7831">were asked to do thousands of flutter kicks, then lie back in cold water with </span><span id="cant-line-7832">waves washing over us. He estimated it would take twenty hours of intensive </span><span id="cant-line-7833">stretching using his protocol to get most of us back to a normal range ofmotion in the hips, which can then be maintained, he said, with just twenty </span><span id="cant-line-7834">minutes of stretching every day. Optimal range of motion required a larger </span><span id="cant-line-7835">commitment. When he got to me he took a good look and shook his head. As </span><span id="cant-line-7836">you know, I’d tasted three Hell Weeks. He started to stretch me out, and said </span><span id="cant-line-7837">I was so locked up it was like trying to stretch steel  cables. </span><span id="cant-line-7838">“You’re gonna need hundreds of hours,” he  said. </span><span id="cant-line-7839">At the time, I didn’ t pay him any mind because I had no plans to take up </span><span id="cant-line-7840">stretching. I was obsessed with strength and power , and everyth ing I’d read </span><span id="cant-line-7841">suggested that an increase in flexibility meant an equal and opposite </span><span id="cant-line-7842">decrease in speed and force. The view from my death bed altered my </span><span id="cant-line-7843">perspective. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7844">I pulled myself up, staggered to the bathroom mirror , turned, and examined </span><span id="cant-line-7845">the knot on my head. I stood as tall as I could. It looked like I’d lost not one, </span><span id="cant-line-7846">but nearly two inches in height.  My range of motion had never been worse. </span><span id="cant-line-7847">What if Joe was  right? </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7848">What  if? </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7849">One of my mottos these days is peaceful but never satisfied . It was one thing </span><span id="cant-line-7850">to enjoy the peace of self-acceptance , and my acceptance of the fucked -up </span><span id="cant-line-7851">world as it is, but that didn’ t mean I was going to lie down and wait to die </span><span id="cant-line-7852">without at least trying to save myself. It didn’ t mean then, and it doesn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-7853">mean now, that I will accept the imperfect or just plain wrong without </span><span id="cant-line-7854">fighting to change things for the better . I’d tried accessing the mainstream </span><span id="cant-line-7855">mind to find healing, but the doctors and their drugs didn’ t do shit except </span><span id="cant-line-7856">make me feel a whole lot worse. I had no other cards to play. All I could do </span><span id="cant-line-7857">is try to stretch myself back to  health. </span><span id="cant-line-7858">The first posture was simple. I sat on the ground and tried to cross my legs, </span><span id="cant-line-7859">Indian style, but my hips were so tight, my knees were up around my ears. I </span><span id="cant-line-7860">lost my balance and rolled onto my back. It took all my strength to right </span><span id="cant-line-7861">myself and try again. I stayed in position for ten seconds, maybe fifteen, </span><span id="cant-line-7862">before straightening my legs because it was too damn  painful.Cramps squeezed and pinched every muscle in my lower body . Sweat oozed </span><span id="cant-line-7863">from my pores, but after a short rest, I folded up my legs and took more </span><span id="cant-line-7864">pain. I cycled through that same stretch on and off for an hour and slowly , </span><span id="cant-line-7865">my body  started  to open. I did a simple quad stretch next. The one we all </span><span id="cant-line-7866">learn to do in middle school. Standing on my left leg, I bent my right and </span><span id="cant-line-7867">grabbed my foot with my right hand. Joe was right. My quads were so bulky </span><span id="cant-line-7868">and tight it was like stretching steel cables. Again, I stayed in the posture </span><span id="cant-line-7869">until the pain was a seven out of ten. Then I took a short break and hit the </span><span id="cant-line-7870">other  side. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7871">That standing posture helped to release my quad and stretch out my psoas. </span><span id="cant-line-7872">The psoas is the only muscle connecting our spine to our lower legs. It wraps </span><span id="cant-line-7873">around the back of the pelvis, governs the hips, and is known as the fight or </span><span id="cant-line-7874">flight muscle. As you know , my whole life was fight or flight.  As a young </span><span id="cant-line-7875">kid drowning in toxic stress, I worked that muscle overtime. Ditto during my </span><span id="cant-line-7876">three Hell Weeks, Ranger School, and Delta Selection. Not to mention war. </span><span id="cant-line-7877">Yet I never did anything to loosen it up, and as an athlete I continued to tap </span><span id="cant-line-7878">my sympathetic  nervous system and had been grinding so hard my psoas </span><span id="cant-line-7879">continued to stiffen. Especially  on long runs, where sleep deprivation and </span><span id="cant-line-7880">cold weather came into play. Now , it was trying to choke me from the inside </span><span id="cant-line-7881">out. I’d learn later that it had tilted my pelvis, compressed my spine, and </span><span id="cant-line-7882">wrapped my connective tissue tight. It shaved two inches off my height. I </span><span id="cant-line-7883">spoke to Joe about it  recently . </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7884">“What was happening to you is an extreme case of what happens to 90 </span><span id="cant-line-7885">percent of the population,” he said. “Your muscles were so locked up that </span><span id="cant-line-7886">your blood wasn ’t circulating very well. They were like a frozen steak. You </span><span id="cant-line-7887">can’t inject blood into a frozen steak, and that’s why you were shutting </span><span id="cant-line-7888">down.” </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7889">And it wouldn’ t let go without a fight. Each stretch plunged me into the fire. </span><span id="cant-line-7890">I had so much inflammation and internal stiffness, the slightest movement </span><span id="cant-line-7891">hurt, say nothin g of long hold poses meant to isolate my quad and psoas. </span><span id="cant-line-7892">When I sat down and did the butterfly stretch next, the torture  intensified. </span><span id="cant-line-7893">I stretched for two hours that day, woke up sore as hell, and got back after it. </span><span id="cant-line-7894">On day two I stretched for six full hours. I did the same three poses over and </span><span id="cant-line-7895">over, then tried to sit on my heels, in a double quad stretch that was pureagony . I worked  a calf stretch in too. Each session started off rough, but after </span><span id="cant-line-7896">an hour or two my body released enough for the pain to ease  up. </span><span id="cant-line-7897">Before long I was folded into stretches for upwards of twelve hours a day. I </span><span id="cant-line-7898">woke up at 6 a.m., stretched until 9 a.m., and then stretched on and off while </span><span id="cant-line-7899">at the desk at work, especially  when I was on the phone. I’d stretch out </span><span id="cant-line-7900">during my lunch hour and then after I got home at 5 p.m., I’d stretch until I </span><span id="cant-line-7901">hit the  sack. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7902">I came up with a routine, starting at my neck and shoulders before moving </span><span id="cant-line-7903">into the hips, psoas, glutes, quads, hamstrings, and calves. Stretching became </span><span id="cant-line-7904">my new obsession. I bought a massage ball to tenderize my psoas. I propped </span><span id="cant-line-7905">a board up against a closed door at a seventy -degree  angle and used it to </span><span id="cant-line-7906">stretch out my calf. I’d been suffering for the better part of two years, and </span><span id="cant-line-7907">after several months of continual stretching, I noticed the bump at the base </span><span id="cant-line-7908">of my skull had started to shrink, along with the knots around my hip </span><span id="cant-line-7909">flexors, and my overall health and energy level improved. I wasn’ t anywhere </span><span id="cant-line-7910">close to flexible yet, and I wasn ’t completely back to myself, but I was off </span><span id="cant-line-7911">all but my thyroid medication , and the more I stretched the more my </span><span id="cant-line-7912">condition improved. I kept at it for at least six hours a day for weeks. Then </span><span id="cant-line-7913">months and years. I’m still doing  it. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7914">*** </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7915">I retired from the military as a Chief in the Navy , in November 2015, the </span><span id="cant-line-7916">only military man ever to be part of Air Force TAC-P, three Navy SEAL </span><span id="cant-line-7917">Hell Weeks in one year (completing two of them), and graduate BUD/S and </span><span id="cant-line-7918">Army Ranger School. It was a bittersweet moment because the military was </span><span id="cant-line-7919">a big part of my identity . It helped shape me and make me a better man, and </span><span id="cant-line-7920">I gave it everything I  had. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7921">By then Bill Brown had moved  on too. He grew up marginalized like me, </span><span id="cant-line-7922">wasn’ t supposed to amount to much, and even got bounced from his first </span><span id="cant-line-7923">BUD/S class by instructors who questioned his intelligence. Today , he is a </span><span id="cant-line-7924">lawyer at a major firm in Philade lphia. Freak Brown proved and continues to </span><span id="cant-line-7925">prove  himself.Sledge is still in the SEAL Teams. When I met him he was a big time </span><span id="cant-line-7926">boozer , but after our workouts his mentality changed. He went from never </span><span id="cant-line-7927">running at all to running marathons. From not owning a bicycle to becoming </span><span id="cant-line-7928">one of the faste st cyclists in San Diego. He’s finished multi ple Ironman </span><span id="cant-line-7929">triathlons. They say iron sharpens iron, and we proved  that. </span><span id="cant-line-7930">Shawn Dobbs never became a SEAL, but he did become an Officer. He’s a </span><span id="cant-line-7931">Lieutenant Com mander these days, and he’s still a hell of an athlete. He’s an </span><span id="cant-line-7932">Ironman, an accomplished cycli st, was honor man in the Navy’ s Advanced </span><span id="cant-line-7933">Dive School, and later earned a graduate degree. One reason for all of his </span><span id="cant-line-7934">success is because he’s come to own his failure in Hell Week, which means </span><span id="cant-line-7935">it no longer owns  him. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7936">SBG is still in the Navy too, but he’s not messing with BUD/ S candidates </span><span id="cant-line-7937">anymore. He analyzes data to make sure Naval Special Warfare continues to </span><span id="cant-line-7938">become smarter , stronger , and more effective than ever. He’s an egghead </span><span id="cant-line-7939">now. An egghead with an edge . But I was with him when he was at his </span><span id="cant-line-7940">physical peak, and he was a fucking  stud. </span><span id="cant-line-7941">Since our dark days in Buffalo and Brazil, my mother has also completely </span><span id="cant-line-7942">transformed her life. She earned  a master ’s degree in education and serves as </span><span id="cant-line-7943">a volunteer on a domestic violence task force, when she’s not working as a </span><span id="cant-line-7944">senior associate vice president at a Nashville medical  school. </span><span id="cant-line-7945">As for me, stretching helped me get my powers back. As my time in the </span><span id="cant-line-7946">military wound down, while I was still in the rehab zone, I studied to </span><span id="cant-line-7947">recertify as an EMT . Once again, I utilized my long-hand  memorization </span><span id="cant-line-7948">skills I’d been honing since high school to finish at the top of my class. I </span><span id="cant-line-7949">also attended TEEX Fire Training Academy , where I graduated Top Honor </span><span id="cant-line-7950">Man in my class. Eventually , I started running again, this time with zero side </span><span id="cant-line-7951">effects, and when I got back into decent enough shape, I entered a few ultras </span><span id="cant-line-7952">and returned to the top spot in several including the Strolling Jim 40- Miler  in </span><span id="cant-line-7953">Tennessee, and Infinitus 88k in Vermont, both in 2016. But that wasn’ t </span><span id="cant-line-7954">enough, so I became a wildland firefighter in  Montana. </span><span id="cant-line-7955">After wrapping up my first season on the fire lines in the summer of 2015, I </span><span id="cant-line-7956">stopped by my mother ’s place in Nashville for a visit. At midnight her phone </span><span id="cant-line-7957">rang. My mother is like me in the sense that she doesn’ t have a wide circleof friends and doesn’t get many phone calls during decent hours, so this was </span><span id="cant-line-7958">either a wrong number or an  emer gency . </span><span id="cant-line-7959">I could hear Trunnis Jr. on the other end of the line. I hadn’ t seen or spoken </span><span id="cant-line-7960">to him in over fifteen years. Our relationship broke down the moment he </span><span id="cant-line-7961">chose to stay with our father rather than tough it out with us. For most of my </span><span id="cant-line-7962">life I found his decision imposs ible to forgive or accept, but like I said, I’d </span><span id="cant-line-7963">changed. Throug h the years, my mother kept me updated on the basics. He’d </span><span id="cant-line-7964">eventually stepp ed away from our father and his shady businesses, earned a </span><span id="cant-line-7965">PhD, and became a college administrator . He is also a great father to his </span><span id="cant-line-7966">kids. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7967">I could tell by my mom’ s voice that something was wrong. All I remember </span><span id="cant-line-7968">hearing was my mom asking, “Are you sure it’s Kayla?” When she hung up, </span><span id="cant-line-7969">she explained that Kayla, his eighteen -year-old daughter , had been hanging </span><span id="cant-line-7970">with friends in Indianapolis. At some point looser acquaintanc es rolled up, </span><span id="cant-line-7971">bad blood boiled, a gun was pulled, shots rang out, and a stray bullet found </span><span id="cant-line-7972">one of the  teenagers. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7973">When his ex-wife called him, in panic mode, he drove to the crime scene, </span><span id="cant-line-7974">but when he arrived he was held outside the yellow tape and kept in the dark. </span><span id="cant-line-7975">He could  see Kayla’ s car and a body under a tarp, but nobody would tell him </span><span id="cant-line-7976">if his daughter was alive or  dead. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7977">My mother and I hit the road immediately . I drove eighty mph through </span><span id="cant-line-7978">slanted rain for five hours straight to Indianapolis. We pulled into his </span><span id="cant-line-7979">driveway shortl y after he returned from the crime scene where, while </span><span id="cant-line-7980">standing outside the yellow tape, he was asked to identify his daughter from </span><span id="cant-line-7981">a picture  of her body taken on a detective’ s cell phone. He wasn ’t offered the </span><span id="cant-line-7982">dignity of privacy or time to pay respects. He had to do all that later. He </span><span id="cant-line-7983">opened the door, took a few steps toward us, and broke down  crying. My </span><span id="cant-line-7984">mother got there first. Then I pulled my brother in for a hug and all of our </span><span id="cant-line-7985">bullshit issues no longer  mattered. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7986">*** </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-7987">The Buddha famously said that life is suffering. I’m not a Buddhist, but I </span><span id="cant-line-7988">know what he meant and so do you. To exist in this world, we must contendwith humiliation , broken dreams, sadness, and loss. That’ s just nature. Each </span><span id="cant-line-7989">specific life comes with its own personalized portion of pain. It’s coming for </span><span id="cant-line-7990">you. Y ou can’ t stop it. And you know  it. </span><span id="cant-line-7991">In response, most of us are programmed to seek comfort as a way to numb it </span><span id="cant-line-7992">all out and cushion the blows. We carve out safe spaces. We consume media </span><span id="cant-line-7993">that confirms our beliefs, we take up hobbies aligned with our talents, we try </span><span id="cant-line-7994">to spend as little time as possible doing the tasks we fucking loathe, and that </span><span id="cant-line-7995">makes us soft. We live a life defined by the limits we imagine and desire for </span><span id="cant-line-7996">ourselves because it’s comfortab le as hell in that box. Not just for us, but for </span><span id="cant-line-7997">our closest family and friends. The limits we create and accept become the </span><span id="cant-line-7998">lens through which they see us. Through which they love and appreciate  us. </span><span id="cant-line-7999">But for some, those limits start to feel like bondage, and when we least </span><span id="cant-line-8000">expect it, our imagination jumps  those walls and hunts down dreams that in </span><span id="cant-line-8001">the immediate aftermath feel attainable. Because most dreams  are. We are </span><span id="cant-line-8002">inspired to make changes little by little, and it hurts. Breaking the shackles </span><span id="cant-line-8003">and stretching beyond our own perceived limits takes hard fucking work— </span><span id="cant-line-8004">oftentimes physi cal work—and when you put yourself on the line, self doubt </span><span id="cant-line-8005">and pain will greet you with a stinging combination that will buckle your </span><span id="cant-line-8006">knees. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-8007">Most people who are merely inspired or motivated will quit at that point, and </span><span id="cant-line-8008">upon their return , their cells will feel that much smaller , their shackles even </span><span id="cant-line-8009">tighter . The few who remain outside their walls will encounte r even more </span><span id="cant-line-8010">pain and much more doubt, courtesy of those who we thought were our </span><span id="cant-line-8011">biggest fans. When it was time for me to lose 106 pounds in less than three </span><span id="cant-line-8012">months, everyone I talked to told me there was no way I could do it. “Don’ t </span><span id="cant-line-8013">expect too much ,” they all said. Their weak -ass dialogue only fed my own </span><span id="cant-line-8014">self doubt. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-8015">But it’s not the external voice that will break you down. It’s what you tell </span><span id="cant-line-8016">yourself that matters. The most important conversations you’ll ever have are </span><span id="cant-line-8017">the ones you’ll have with yourself. Y ou wake up with them, you walk around </span><span id="cant-line-8018">with them, you go to bed with them, and eventually you act on them. </span><span id="cant-line-8019">Whether they be good or  bad.We are all our own worst haters and doubters because self doubt is a natural </span><span id="cant-line-8020">reaction to any bold attempt to change your life for the better . You can’t stop </span><span id="cant-line-8021">it from bloomin g in your brain, but you can neutralize it, and all the other </span><span id="cant-line-8022">external chatter by asking, What  if? </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-8023">What if is an exquisite fuck-you to anyone who has ever doubted your </span><span id="cant-line-8024">greatness or stood in your way. It silences negativity . It’s a reminder that you </span><span id="cant-line-8025">don’t really know what you’re capable of until you put everything you’ve </span><span id="cant-line-8026">got on the line. It makes the impossible feel at least a little more possible. </span><span id="cant-line-8027">What if  is the power and permission to face down your darkest demons, your </span><span id="cant-line-8028">very worst mem ories, and accept them as part of your history . If and when </span><span id="cant-line-8029">you do that, you will be able to use them as fuel to envisi on the most </span><span id="cant-line-8030">audacious, outrageous achievement and go get  it. </span><span id="cant-line-8031">We live in a world with a lot of insecure, jealous people. Some  of them are </span><span id="cant-line-8032">our best friends. They are blood relatives. Failure terrifies them. So does our </span><span id="cant-line-8033">success. Because when we transcend what we once thought possible, push </span><span id="cant-line-8034">our limits, and become more, our light reflects off all the walls they’ve built </span><span id="cant-line-8035">up around them. Your light enables them to see the contours of their own </span><span id="cant-line-8036">prison, their own self-limitations . But if they are truly the great people you </span><span id="cant-line-8037">always believed  them to be, their jealousy will evolve, and soon their </span><span id="cant-line-8038">imagination might hop its fence, and it will be their turn to change for the </span><span id="cant-line-8039">better . </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-8040">I hope that’s what this book has done for you. I hope that right now you are </span><span id="cant-line-8041">nose-to-concrete  with your own bullshit limits you didn’ t even know were </span><span id="cant-line-8042">there. I hope you’re willing to do the work to break them down. I hope </span><span id="cant-line-8043">you’re willing to change. You’ll feel pain, but if you accept it, endure it, and </span><span id="cant-line-8044">callous your mind, you’ll reach a point where not even pain can hurt you. </span><span id="cant-line-8045">There is a catch, however . When you live this way , there is no end to  it. </span><span id="cant-line-8046">Thanks to all that stretching, I’m in better shape at forty -three  than I was in </span><span id="cant-line-8047">my twen ties. Back then I was always sick, wound tight, and stressed out. I </span><span id="cant-line-8048">never analyzed why I kept getting stress fractures. I just taped that shit up. </span><span id="cant-line-8049">No matter what ailed my body or my mind I had the same solution. Tape it </span><span id="cant-line-8050">up and move the fuck on. Now I’m smarter than I’ve ever been. And I’m </span><span id="cant-line-8051">still getting after  it.In 2018 I went back to the mountains to become a wildland firefighter again. </span><span id="cant-line-8052">I hadn’ t been in the field for three years, and since then I’d gotten used to </span><span id="cant-line-8053">training in nice gyms and living in comfort. Some might call it luxury . I was </span><span id="cant-line-8054">in a plush hotel room in Vegas when the 416 fire sparked and I got the call. </span><span id="cant-line-8055">What started as a 2,000- acre grass fire in the San Juan Range of Colorado’ s </span><span id="cant-line-8056">Rocky Mountains was growing into a record breaking, 55,000- acre monster . </span><span id="cant-line-8057">I hung up and caught a prop plane to Grand Junction, loaded up in a U.S. </span><span id="cant-line-8058">Forest Service truck, and drove three hours to the outskirts of Durango, </span><span id="cant-line-8059">Colorado, where I suited up in my green Nomex pants and yellow , long- </span><span id="cant-line-8060">sleeved  button down, my hard hat, field glasses, and gloves, and grabbed my </span><span id="cant-line-8061">super Pulaski—a wildland fire fighter ’s most trusted weapon. I can dig for </span><span id="cant-line-8062">hours with that thing, and that’s what we do. We don’t spray water . We </span><span id="cant-line-8063">specialize in containment, and that means digging lines and clearing brush so </span><span id="cant-line-8064">there’ s no fuel in the path of an inferno. We dig and run, run and dig, until </span><span id="cant-line-8065">every muscle is spent. Then we do it all over  again. </span><span id="cant-line-8066">On our first day and night we dug fire lines around vulnerab le homes as </span><span id="cant-line-8067">walls of flames marched forwar d from less than a mile away . We glimpsed </span><span id="cant-line-8068">the burn through the trees and felt the heat in the drought -stricken  forest. </span><span id="cant-line-8069">From there we were deployed to 10,000 feet and worked on a forty -five- </span><span id="cant-line-8070">degree  slope, digging as deep as possible, trying to get to the mineral soil </span><span id="cant-line-8071">that won’ t burn. At one point a tree fell and missed hitting one of my </span><span id="cant-line-8072">teammates by eight inches. It would have killed him. We could smell smoke </span><span id="cant-line-8073">in the air. Our sawyers—the chainsaw experts—kept cutting dead and dying </span><span id="cant-line-8074">trees. We haule d that brush out beyond a creek bed. Piles were scattered </span><span id="cant-line-8075">every fifty feet for over three miles. Each one measured roughly seven to </span><span id="cant-line-8076">eight feet  tall. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-8077">We worked like that for a week of eighteen -hour shifts at $12 an hour , before </span><span id="cant-line-8078">taxes. It was eighty degrees during the day and thirty -six degrees  at night. </span><span id="cant-line-8079">When the shift was over we laid out our mats and slept in the open wherever </span><span id="cant-line-8080">we were. Then woke up and got back after it. I didn’ t change my clothes for </span><span id="cant-line-8081">six days. Most of the people on my crew were at least fifteen years younger </span><span id="cant-line-8082">than me. All of them were hard as nails and among the very hardest working </span><span id="cant-line-8083">people I’ve ever met. Including and especially the women. None of them </span><span id="cant-line-8084">ever complained. When we were done we’d cleared a line 3.2 miles long, </span><span id="cant-line-8085">wide enough to stop a monster from burning down a  mountain.At forty -three , my wildland firefighting caree r is just getting started. I love </span><span id="cant-line-8086">being part of a team of hard motherfuckers like them, and my ultra career is </span><span id="cant-line-8087">about to be born again too. I’m just young enough to bring hell on and still </span><span id="cant-line-8088">contend for titles. I’m running faster now than I ever have, and I don’t need </span><span id="cant-line-8089">any tape or props for my feet. When I was thirty -three  I ran at an 8:35 per </span><span id="cant-line-8090">mile pace. Now I’m running 7:15 per mile very comfortably . I’m still getting </span><span id="cant-line-8091">used to this new, flexible, fully functioning body , and getting accustomed to </span><span id="cant-line-8092">my new  self. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-8093">My passion still burns, but to be honest, it takes a bit longer to channel my </span><span id="cant-line-8094">rage. It’s not camped out on my home screen anymore, a single  unconscious </span><span id="cant-line-8095">twitch from overwhelming my heart and head. Now I have to access it </span><span id="cant-line-8096">consciously . But when I do, I can still feel all the challenges and obstacles, </span><span id="cant-line-8097">the heartbreak and hard work, like it happened yesterday . That’s why you </span><span id="cant-line-8098">can feel my passion on podcast s and videos. That shit is still there, seared </span><span id="cant-line-8099">into my brain like scar tissue. Tailing me like a shadow that’s trying to chase </span><span id="cant-line-8100">me down and swallow me whole, but always drives me  forward. </span><span id="cant-line-8101">Whatever failures and accomplishments pile up in the years to come, and </span><span id="cant-line-8102">there will be plenty of both I’m sure, I know I’ll continue to give it my all </span><span id="cant-line-8103">and set goals that seem impossi ble to most. And when those motherfuckers </span><span id="cant-line-8104">say so, I’ll look them dead in the eye and respond with one simple  question. </span><span id="cant-line-8105">What  if?ACKNOWLEDGMENTS </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-8106">THIS BOO K  WAS  SEVEN  YEARS  IN  THE  MAKING  WITH  SIX  FAILED  ATTEMPTS  ALONG </span><span id="cant-line-8107">the way before being introduce d to the first, and only, writer who truly </span><span id="cant-line-8108">understood my passion and captured my voice. I want to thank Adam </span><span id="cant-line-8109">Skolnick for the countless hours spent learning everything about me and my </span><span id="cant-line-8110">fucked-up life to help pull toget her all the pieces and bring my story to life </span><span id="cant-line-8111">in print. Words can’t express how proud I am of the truthfulness, </span><span id="cant-line-8112">vulnerability , and raw candor of this  book. </span><span id="cant-line-8113">Jennifer Kish, I do not have the words. A lot of people say that, but it is the </span><span id="cant-line-8114">truth. Only you truly know how hard this process was for me to pull off, </span><span id="cant-line-8115">and without you by my side there would be no book at all. It is because of </span><span id="cant-line-8116">you I was able to take time off of writing to go fight fires while you took </span><span id="cant-line-8117">care of all the business behind the book. Knowing I had “Kish” in my </span><span id="cant-line-8118">corner enabled me to make the very ballsy decision to self-publish ! It’s </span><span id="cant-line-8119">because of your work ethic that I had the confidence to turn down a </span><span id="cant-line-8120">substantial book advance—knowing that you alone can should er what an </span><span id="cant-line-8121">entire publishing house can do! All I can say is thank you and I love  you. </span><span id="cant-line-8122">My mom, Jackie Gardner , we have had a hard, fucked -up life. One that we </span><span id="cant-line-8123">can both be proud of because there are many times we have been knocked </span><span id="cant-line-8124">flat on our asses with no one around to pick us up. Somehow we found a </span><span id="cant-line-8125">way to always get the fuck up. I know there were many times when you </span><span id="cant-line-8126">were concerned for me and wanted me to stop, thank you for never acting </span><span id="cant-line-8127">upon your feelings as it allowed me to find more of me. For most people, </span><span id="cant-line-8128">this is not how you would talk to your mother as a thank you, but only you </span><span id="cant-line-8129">know how powerful this message truly is. Stay hard; love you, Mom. </span><span id="cant-line-8130">My brother, Trunnis. Our lives and the way we grew up at times made us </span><span id="cant-line-8131">enemies, but when the shit hit the fan, we were there for one another . At the </span><span id="cant-line-8132">end of the day , that is true brotherhood to  me. </span><span id="cant-line-8133">Much appreciati on and thanks to the following people who allowed Adam </span><span id="cant-line-8134">and I to interview  them for this book. Your recollection of the events helped </span><span id="cant-line-8135">me creat e an accurate and true depiction of my life and how these particular </span><span id="cant-line-8136">events  unfolded.My cousin, Dam ien, while you were always the favorite growin g up, I had </span><span id="cant-line-8137">some of my better times in life hanging out with you just doing stupid  shit. </span><span id="cant-line-8138">Johnny Nichols , our friendship while growing up in Brazil was the only </span><span id="cant-line-8139">positive thing I had at times. Not many people know the darkness that I </span><span id="cant-line-8140">experienced as a kid like you do. Thanks for being there when I truly </span><span id="cant-line-8141">needed you  most. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-8142">Kirk Freeman, I want to thank you for your honesty . You were  one of the </span><span id="cant-line-8143">few people who were willing to tell the painful truth about some of my </span><span id="cant-line-8144">challenges in Brazil, and for that I will forever be  grateful. </span><span id="cant-line-8145">Scott Gearen, to this day, you will never know how much your story and </span><span id="cant-line-8146">you just being you helped me at a time in my life where darkness was all I </span><span id="cant-line-8147">could see. You have no idea the impact you had on a fourteen -year-old kid. </span><span id="cant-line-8148">It’s a true sayin g, you never know who is watching you. I happened to be </span><span id="cant-line-8149">watching you that day at PJOC school. Grateful for your friendship after all </span><span id="cant-line-8150">these  years. </span><br><br><span id="cant-line-8151">Victor Peña, I have many stories to tell, but the one thing I will say is that </span><span id="cant-line-8152">you were always there through thick and thin and always gave everything </span><span id="cant-line-8153">you had. For that, mad respect, brother . </span><span id="cant-line-8154">Steven Schaljo, if it weren’ t for you, there might not even be a book.
