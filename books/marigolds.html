        When I think of the hometown of my youth, all
        that I seem to remember is dust—the brown, crumbly
        dust of late summer—arid, sterile dust that gets into
        the eyes and makes them water, gets into the throat
        and between the toes of bare brown feet. I don’t know
        why I should remember only the dust. Surely there
        must have been lush green lawns and paved streets
        under leafy shade trees somewhere in town; but
        memory is an abstract painting—it does not present
        things as they are, but rather as they feel. And so,
        when I think of that time and that place, I remember
        only the dry September of the dirt roads and grassless
        yards of the shantytown where I lived. And one other
        thing I remember, another incongruency of
        memory—a brilliant splash of sunny yellow against the
        dust—Miss Lottie’s marigolds.
        Whenever the memory of those marigolds
        flashes across my mind, a strange nostalgia comes
        with it and remains long after the picture has faded. I
        feel again the chaotic emotions of adolescence,
        illusive as smoke, yet as real as the potted geranium
        before me now. Joy and rage and wild animal
        gladness and shame become tangled together in the
        multicolored skein of fourteen-going-on-fifteen as I
        recall that devastating moment when I was suddenly
        more woman than child, years ago in Miss Lottie’s
        yard. I think of those marigolds at the strangest times; I
        remember them vividly now as I desperately pass
        away the time.
        I suppose that futile waiting was the sorrowful
        background music of our impoverished little
        community when I was young. The Depression that
        gripped the nation was no new thing to us, for the
        black workers of rural Maryland had always been
        depressed. I don’t know what it was that we were
        waiting for; certainly not for the prosperity that was
        “just around the corner,” for those were white folks’
        words, which we never believed. Nor did we wait for
        hard work and thrift to pay off in shining success, as
        the American Dream promised, for we knew better
        than that, too. Perhaps we waited for a miracle,
        amorphous in concept but necessary if one were to
        have the grit to rise before dawn each day and labor in
        the white man’s vineyard until after dark, or to wander
        about in the September dust offering one’s sweat in
        return for some meager share of bread. But God was
        chary with miracles in those days, and so we
        waited—and waited.
        We children, of course, were only vaguely
        aware of the extent of our poverty. Having no radios,
        few newspapers, and no magazines, we were
        somewhat unaware of the world outside our
        community. Nowadays we would be called culturally
        deprived and people would write books and hold
        conferences about us. In those days everybody we
        knew was just as hungry and ill clad as we were.
        Poverty was the cage in which we all were trapped,
        and our hatred of it was still the vague, undirected
        restlessness of the zoo-bred flamingo who knows that
        nature created him to fly free.
        incongruency: inconsistency; lack of agreement or
        harmony
        multicolored skein: The writer is comparing her many
        feelings to a skein, or long coiled piece of many
        colored yarn.
        amorphous: vague, shapeless.
        chary: not generous.
        As I think of those days I feel most poignantly
        the tag end of summer, the bright, dry times when we
        began to have a sense of shortening days and the
        imminence of the cold.
        By the time I was fourteen, my brother Joey
        and I were the only children left at our house, the older
        ones having left home for early marriage or the lure of
        the city, and the two babies having been sent to
        relatives who might care for them better than we. Joey
        was three years younger than I, and a boy, and
        therefore vastly inferior. Each morning our mother and
        father trudged wearily down the dirt road and around
        the bend, she to her domestic job, he to his daily
        unsuccessful quest for work. After our few chores
        around the tumbledown shanty, Joey and I were free
        to run wild in the sun with other children similarly
        situated.
        For the most part, those days are ill-defined in
        my memory, running together and combining like a
        fresh watercolor painting left out in the rain. I
        remember squatting in the road drawing a picture in
        the dust, a picture which Joey gleefully erased with
        one sweep of his dirty foot. I remember fishing for
        minnows in a muddy creek and watching sadly as they
        eluded my cupped hands, while Joey laughed
        uproariously. And I remember, that year, a strange
        restlessness of body and of spirit, a feeling that
        something old and familiar was ending, and something
        unknown and therefore terrifying was beginning.
        -2-
        One day returns to me with special clarity for
        some reason, perhaps because it was the beginning of
        the experience that in some inexplicable way marked
        the end of innocence. I was loafing under the great
        oak tree in our yard, deep in some reverie which I
        have now forgotten, except that it involved some
        secret, secret thoughts of one of the Harris boys
        across the yard. Joey and a bunch of kids were bored
        now with the old tire suspended from an oak limb,
        which had kept them entertained for a while.
        “Hey, Lizabeth,” Joey yelled. He never talked
        when he could yell. “Hey, Lizabeth, let’s go
        somewhere.”
        I came reluctantly from my private world.
        “Where you want to go? What you want to do?”
        The truth was that we were becoming tired of
        the formlessness of our summer days. The idleness
        whose prospect had seemed so beautiful during the
        busy days of spring now had degenerated to an almost
        desperate effort to fill up the empty midday hours.
        “Let’s go see can we find some locusts on the
        hill,” someone suggested.
        Joey was scornful. “Ain’t no more locusts there.
        Y’all got ‘em all while they was still green.”
        The argument that followed was brief and not
        really worth the effort. Hunting locust trees wasn’t fun
        anymore by now.
        “Tell you what,” said Joey finally, his eyes
        sparkling. “Let’s us go over to Miss Lottie’s.”
        Clarity: n.: clearness.
        Inexplicable: not explainable or understandable.
        The idea caught on at once, for annoying Miss
        Lottie was always fun. I was still child enough to
        scamper along with the group over rickety fences and
        through bushes that tore our already raggedy clothes,
        back to where Miss Lottie lived. I think now that we
        must have made a tragicomic spectacle, five or six
        kids of different ages, each of us clad in only one
        garment—the girls in faded dresses that were too long
        or too short, the boys in patchy pants, their sweaty
        brown chests gleaming in the hot sun. A little cloud of
        dust followed our thin legs and bare feet as we
        tramped over the barren land.
        When Miss Lottie’s house came into view we
        stopped, ostensibly to plan our strategy, but actually
        to reinforce our courage. Miss Lottie’s house was the
        most ramshackle of all our ramshackle homes. The
        sun and rain had long since faded its rickety frame
        siding from white to a sullen gray. The boards
        themselves seemed to remain upright not from being
        nailed together but rather from leaning together, like a
        house that a child might have constructed from cards.
        A brisk wind might have blown it down, and the fact
        that it was still standing implied a kind of enchantment
        that was stronger than the elements. There it stood
        and as far as I know is standing yet—a gray, rotting
        thing with no porch, no shutters, no steps, set on a
        cramped lot with no grass, not even any weeds—a
        monument to decay.
        In front of the house in a squeaky rocking chair
        sat Miss Lottie’s son, John Burke, completing the
        impression of decay. John Burke was what was known
        as queer-headed. Black and ageless, he sat rocking
        day in and day out in a mindless stupor, lulled by the
        monotonous squeak-squawk of the chair. A battered
        hat atop his shaggy head shaded him from the sun.
        Usually John Burke was totally unaware of everything
        outside his quiet dream world. But if you disturbed him,
        if you intruded upon his fantasies, he would become
        enraged, strike out at you, and curse at you in some
        strange enchanted language which only he could
        understand. We children made a game of thinking of
        ways to disturb John Burke and then to elude his
        violent retribution.
        But our real fun and our real fear lay in Miss
        Lottie herself. Miss Lottie seemed to be at least a
        hundred years old. Her big frame still held traces of the
        tall, powerful woman she must have been in youth,
        although it was now bent and drawn. Her smooth skin
        was a dark reddish brown, and her face had Indian-like
        features and the stern stoicism that one associates
        with Indian faces. Miss Lottie didn’t like intruders
        either, especially children. She never left her yard, and
        nobody ever visited her. We never knew how she
        managed those necessities which depend on human
        interaction—how she ate, for example, or even
        whether she ate. When we were tiny children, we
        thought Miss Lottie was a witch and we made up tales
        that we half believed ourselves about her exploits. We
        were far too sophisticated now, of course, to believe
        the witch nonsense. But old fears have a way of
        clinging like cobwebs, and so when we sighted the
        tumbledown shack, we had to stop to reinforce our
        nerves.
        “Look, there she is,” I whispered, forgetting that
        Miss Lottie could not possibly have heard me from that
        distance. “She’s fooling with them crazy flowers.”
        “Yeh, look at ‘er.”
        ostensibly: seemingly; apparently.
        retribution: n.: revenge.
        stoicism: calm indifference to pleasure or pain.
        -3-
        Miss Lottie’s marigolds were perhaps the
        strangest part of the picture. Certainly they did not fit in
        with the crumbling decay of the rest of her yard.
        Beyond the dusty brown yard, in front of the sorry gray
        house, rose suddenly and shockingly a dazzling strip
        of bright blossoms, clumped together in enormous
        mounds, warm and passionate and sun-golden. The
        old black witch-woman worked on them all summer,
        every summer, down on her creaky knees, weeding
        and cultivating and arranging, while the house
        crumbled and John Burke rocked. For some perverse
        reason, we children hated those marigolds. They
        interfered with the perfect ugliness of the place; they
        were too beautiful; they said too much that we could
        not understand; they did not make sense. There was
        something in the vigor with which the old woman
        destroyed the weeds that intimidated us. It should
        have been a comical sight—the old woman with the
        man’s hat on her cropped white head, leaning over the
        bright mounds, her big backside in the air—but it
        wasn’t comical, it was something we could not name.
        We had to annoy her by whizzing a pebble into her
        flowers or by yelling a dirty word, then dancing away
        from her rage, reveling in our youth and mocking her
        age. Actually, I think it was the flowers we wanted to
        destroy, but nobody had the nerve to try it, not even
        Joey, who was usually fool enough to try anything.
        “Y’all git some stones,” commanded Joey now
        and was met with instant giggling obedience as
        everyone except me began to gather pebbles from the
        dusty ground. “Come on, Lizabeth.”
        I just stood there peering through the bushes,
        torn between wanting to join the fun and feeling that it
        was all a bit silly.
        “You scared, Lizabeth?”
        I cursed and spat on the ground—my favorite gesture
        of phony bravado. “Y’all children get the stones, I’ll
        show you how to use ‘em.”
        I said before that we children were not
        consciously aware of how thick were the bars of our
        cage. I wonder now, though, whether we were not
        more aware of it than I thought. Perhaps we had some
        dim notion of what we were, and how little chance we
        had of being anything else. Otherwise, why would we
        have been so preoccupied with destruction? Anyway,
        the pebbles were collected quickly, and everybody
        looked at me to begin the fun.
        “Come on, y’all.”
        We crept to the edge of the bushes that
        bordered the narrow road in front of Miss Lottie’s
        place. She was working placidly, kneeling over the
        flowers, her dark hand plunged into the golden mound.
        Suddenly zing—an expertly aimed stone cut the head
        off one of the blossoms.
        “Who out there?” Miss Lottie’s backside came
        down and her head came up as her sharp eyes
        searched the bushes. “You better git!”
        We had crouched down out of sight in the
        bushes, where we stifled the giggles that insisted on
        coming. Miss Lottie gazed warily across the road for a
        moment, then cautiously returned to her weeding.
        Zing—Joey sent a pebble into the blooms, and
        another marigold was beheaded.
        intimidated: v.: frightened.
        Miss Lottie was enraged now. She began
        struggling to her feet, leaning on a rickety cane and
        shouting. “Y’all git! Go on home!” Then the rest of the
        kids let loose with their pebbles, storming the flowers
        and laughing wildly and senselessly at Miss Lottie’s
        impotent rage. She shook her stick at us and started
        shakily toward the road crying, “Git ‘long! John Burke!
        John Burke, come help!”
        Then I lost my head entirely, mad with the
        power of inciting such rage, and ran out of the bushes
        in the storm of pebbles, straight toward Miss Lottie,
        chanting madly, “Old witch, fell in a ditch, picked up a
        penny and thought she was rich!” The children
        screamed with delight, dropped their pebbles, and
        joined the crazy dance, swarming around Miss Lottie
        like bees and chanting, “Old lady witch!” while she
        screamed curses at us. The madness lasted only a
        moment, for John Burke, startled at last, lurched out of
        his chair, and we dashed for the bushes just as Miss
        Lottie’s cane went whizzing at my head.
        I did not join the merriment when the kids
        gathered again under the oak in our bare yard.
        Suddenly I was ashamed, and I did not like being
        ashamed. The child in me sulked and said it was all in
        fun, but the woman in me flinched at the thought of the
        malicious attack that I had led. The mood lasted all
        afternoon. When we ate the beans and rice that was
        supper that night, I did not notice my father’s silence,
        for he was always silent these days, nor did I notice
        my mother’s absence, for she always worked until well
        into evening. Joey and I had a particularly bitter
        argument after supper; his exuberance got on my
        nerves. Finally I stretched out upon the pallet in the
        room we shared and fell into a fitful doze.
        When I awoke, somewhere in the middle of the
        night, my mother had returned, and I vaguely listened
        to the conversation that was audible through the thin
        walls that separated our rooms. At first I heard no
        words, only voices. My mother’s voice was like a cool,
        dark room in summer—peaceful, soothing, quiet. I
        -4-
        loved to listen to it; it made things seem all right
        somehow. But my father’s voice cut through hers,
        shattering the peace.
        “Twenty-two years, Maybelle, twenty-two
        years,” he was saying, “and I got nothing for you,
        nothing, nothing.”
        “It’s all right, honey, you’ll get something.
        Everybody out of work now, you know that.”
        “It ain’t right. Ain’t no man ought to eat his
        woman’s food year in and year out, and see his
        children running wild. Ain’t nothing right about that.”
        “Honey, you took good care of us when you
        had it. Ain’t nobody got nothing nowadays.”
        “I ain’t talking about nobody else, I m talking
        about me. God knows I try.” My mother said something
        I could not hear, and my father cried out louder, “What
        must a man do, tell me that?”
        “Look, we ain’t starving. I git paid every week,
        and Mrs. Ellis is real nice about giving me things. She
        gonna let me have Mr. Ellis’s old coat for you this
        winter—”
        impotent: adj.: powerless; helpless.
        pallet: small bed or cot.
        “Damn Mr. Ellis’s coat! And damn his money!
        You think I want white folks’ leavings?
        “Damn, Maybelle”—and suddenly he sobbed,
        loudly and painfully, and cried helplessly and
        hopelessly in the dark night. I had never heard a man
        cry before. I did not know men ever cried. I covered
        my ears with my hands but could not cut off the sound
        of my father’s harsh, painful, despairing sobs. My
        father was a strong man who could whisk a child upon
        his shoulders and go singing through the house. My
        father whittled toys for us, and laughed so loud that the
        great oak seemed to laugh with him, and taught us
        how to fish and hunt rabbits. How could it be that my
        father was crying? But the sobs went on, unstifled,
        finally quieting until I could hear my mother’s voice,
        deep and rich, humming softly as she used to hum to a
        frightened child.
        The world had lost its boundary lines. My
        mother, who was small and soft, was now the strength
        of the family; my father, who was the rock on which the
        family had been built, was sobbing like the tiniest child.
        Everything was suddenly out of tune, like a broken
        accordion. Where did I fit into this crazy picture? I do
        not now remember my thoughts, only a feeling of great
        bewilderment and fear.
        Long after the sobbing and humming had
        stopped, I lay on the pallet, still as stone with my
        hands over my ears, wishing that I too could cry and
        be comforted. The night was silent now except for the
        sound of the crickets and of Joey’s soft breathing. But
        the room was too crowded with fear to allow me to
        sleep, and finally, feeling the terrible aloneness of 4
        A.M., I decided to awaken Joey.
        “Ouch! What’s the matter with you? What you
        want?” he demanded disagreeably when I had pinched
        and slapped him awake.
        “Come on, wake up.”
        “What for? Go ‘way.”
        I was lost for a reasonable reply. I could not
        say, “I’m scared and I don’t want to be alone,” so I
        merely said, “I’m going out. If you want to come, come
        on.”
        The promise of adventure awoke him. “Going
        out now? Where to, Lizabeth? What you going to do?”
        I was pulling my dress over my head. Until now
        I had not thought of going out. “Just come on,” I replied
        tersely.
        I was out the window and halfway down the
        road before Joey caught up with me.
        “Wait, Lizabeth, where you going?”
        I was running as if the Furies were after me,
        as perhaps they were—running silently and furiously
        until I came to where I had half known I was headed:
        to Miss Lottie’s yard.
        The half-dawn light was more eerie than
        complete darkness, and in it the old house was like the
        ruin that my world had become—foul and crumbling, a
        grotesque caricature. It looked haunted, but I was not
        afraid, because I was haunted too.
        “Lizabeth, you lost your mind?” panted Joey.
        Furies: in Greek and Roman mythology, spirits who
        pursue people who have committed crimes,
        sometimes driving them mad.
        I had indeed lost my mind, for all the
        smoldering emotions of that summer swelled in me
        and burst—the great need for my mother who was
        never there, the hopelessness of our poverty and
        degradation, the bewilderment of being neither child
        nor woman and yet both at once, the fear unleashed
        by my father’s tears. And these feelings combined in
        one great impulse toward destruction.
        -5-


        “Lizabeth!”
        I leaped furiously into the mounds of marigolds
        and pulled madly, trampling and pulling and destroying
        the perfect yellow blooms. The fresh smell of early
        morning and of dew-soaked marigolds spurred me on
        as I went tearing and mangling and sobbing while Joey
        tugged my dress or my waist crying, “Lizabeth, stop,
        please stop!”


        And then I was sitting in the ruined little garden
        among the uprooted and ruined flowers, crying and
        crying, and it was too late to undo what I had done.
        Joey was sitting beside me, silent and frightened, not
        knowing what to say. Then, “Lizabeth, look!’
        I opened my swollen eyes and saw in front of
        me a pair of large, calloused feet; my gaze lifted to the
        swollen legs, the age-distorted body clad in a tight
        cotton nightdress, and then the shadowed Indian face
        surrounded by stubby white hair. And there was no
        rage in the face now, now that the garden was
        destroyed and there was nothing any longer to be
        protected.


        “M-miss Lottie!” I scrambled to my feet and just
        stood there and stared at her, and that was the
        moment when childhood faded and womanhood
        began. That violent, crazy act was the last act of
        childhood. For as I gazed at the immobile face with the
        sad, weary eyes, I gazed upon a kind of reality which
        is hidden to childhood. The witch was no longer a
        witch but only a broken old woman who had dared to
        create beauty in the midst of ugliness and sterility. She
        had been born in squalor and lived in it all her life. Now
        at the end of that life she had nothing except a fallingdown hut, a wrecked body, and John Burke, the
        mindless son of her passion. Whatever verve there
        was left in her, whatever was of love and beauty and
        joy that had not been squeezed out by life, had been
        there in the marigolds she had so tenderly cared for.
        Of course I could not express the things that I
        knew about Miss Lottie as I stood there awkward and
        ashamed. The years have put words to the things I
        knew in that moment, and as I look back upon it, I
        know that that moment marked the end of innocence.
        Innocence involves an unseeing acceptance of things
        at face value, an ignorance of the area below the
        surface. In that humiliating moment I looked beyond
        myself and into the depths of another person. This was
        the beginning of compassion, and one cannot have
        both compassion and innocence.
        The years have taken me worlds away from
        that time and that place, from the dust and squalor of
        our lives, and from the bright thing that I destroyed in a
        blind, childish striking out at God knows what. Miss
        Lottie died long ago and many years have passed
        since I last saw her hut, completely barren at last, for
        despite my wild contrition she never planted
        marigolds again. Yet, there are times when the image
        of those passionate yellow mounds returns with a
        painful poignancy. For one does not have to be
        ignorant and poor to find that his life is as barren as
        the dusty yards of our town. And I too have planted
        marigolds
